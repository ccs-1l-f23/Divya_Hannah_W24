My grandson reviewed this screwdriver and I purchased it for his Christmas.  He loves it.  The ratched is superior with internal bit holders.  He carries it everyday to his HS Robotics class.  LTT stands by their products and is an easy company to work with.
"I haven't tried many screwdrivers, but this feels amazing and I will not buy anything else!"
Now I need one for the garage as well! Nice work LTT!
"I know Linus goes on and on about how much thought went into designing the screwdriver, but it simply works. And in my opinion that is the most important trait of a tool. It gets the job done, naturally."
Feels great and has most basic utilities and bits

"It's a great screwdriver. I have had 0 issues when using it, and it is perfect for the many use cases I've used it for."
"I got this mainly for around the house stuff and working on my car, honestly couldn’t be happier. For the price some may say it’s expensive, but for people who would use this often and care about build quality I’d 1000% recommend it. When I received it i wasn’t expecting it to be so heavy but in my opinion It’s a good thing, it adds to the premium feel of the screwdriver, which might I say is the best I’ve ever seen/felt. I keep it on my desk just incase I need it quick but I always find myself just using it as a fidget toy when I’m bored. ALSO the magnet in this screwdriver is the strongest I’ve ever seen good luck trying to drop your screws. Go buy it!"
"It's expensive, but I took the plunge.  Joining my large collection of screwdrivers, it's a welcome collaborator.  Balance is good and the number of heads it keeps tucked away is impressive.  Don't love the non-standard tip size (really!?!?).  And I still prefer my bi-directional Craftsman SpeedDrive over this in most circumstances and smaller ones for electronics, doubly so given this is absurdly priced in comparison to those.  It's a fine screwdriver but just doesn't live up to the hype for me."
"The screwdriver is awesome. Very satisfying click, little back force. Really good build quality - not perfect though. Get a stavby one, too - it's going to be handy on business trips. I wish I could take mine everywhere..."
I’ve ended up purchasing one for my father-in-law and uncle. Lost it for a week and almost ordered a second for myself. It’s spoiled me fast.

"I've fallen in love with this screwdriver, as a Network tech this has to be the one of the best tools in my arsenal, next to my Fluke of course. The knurling is a godsend and the ratcheting mechanism is so light its perfect... The only downfall of the screwdriver is the bit retention clips, within the first week I've already had a clip break off so I'm down one bit in the handle, doesn't give me much faith for the longevity of the bit holders and might be looking for a case to hold it and bits in the future..."
Definitely the best screwdriver in the world.
"Is it expensive? Sure. Do you get your moneys worth? Yes. Are there some minor things I would change? Sure, but they wouldn’t stop me from buying it again. The default bit selection leaves something to be desired. Plastic is a little extra smooth, but they also had sound reasoning for that decision so fair enough. All around a good purchase. 9/10 would buy again."
"Excellent, works like a dream"
I bought a megapro automotive screwdriver ever since Linus announced they are thinking about making this. I needed another screwdriver for convenience  and decided to finally buy this. I didn’t think there would be such a difference between the megapro and this but what a difference. The ltt screwdriver is so much lighter and the shaft being smaller makes it so much easier to use especially for extended use. The magnet is so much better holding screws. The ratchet feels great and the knurling on the shaft makes it so much easier to grip.  Only minor complaint is with the black bits it can be harder to read the sizes in low light vs grey bits.

"I really enjoyed the screwdriver, great finishes and feel, and i was very satisfied with the packaging quality."
"I've never used expensive screwdrivers before, and didn't really know what to expect from an expensive one. I'm a little surprised at how much of a difference it makes. Using it is so much faster as you're able to put pressure on better spots, but that also means less rounding of screws. The old workflow where I'd switch to using my hand when the screw got loose is now gone (as using the ratchet is *way* faster).s"
"I purchased during LTT's Black Friday sale in 2023, which I'm sure is a high volume purchase time. I didn't receive the order until early 2024. So a little over 2 months. This wasn't a problem for me, and some of the items I ordered were sold out so I didn't receive them. I really enjoy LTT's content and the screwdriver has been great, but people should be aware that if they purchase during a large sale, it may take a while to receive it."
"I've not used it often, but when using it, it's a joy. \nIt feels great, it's balanced, the bit holder is great!\nAnd now I've finally paid my \""adblocker\"" debt."
"I really could not imagine that the screwdriver is as good as Linus made it out to be, but it really is! Worth every penny. What sucked a bit was that I had to pay taxes in Canada AND in Germany, but what can you do."

"I have to say, I am pretty sceptical of merch since It's mostly Not much more than Dropshopping (at least fro m my passt experiences). I haven't used the screwdriver too much, but until now its holding up quite well. I hope the small brackets that hold the bits in place do not break off, they seem a bit thin to me. But time will tell"
This is the only tool I own that doesn't live in my tool bag. This lives on my desk in case I ever need it quickly. The fact that it stores the bits in the handle makes it super convenient for someone like me who is very disorganized.
"I purchased this as a gift for my husband, and he is really pleased with the screwdriver. I have a similar screwdriver myself, but with a much larger handle, and this narrower one fits into more places than my old one. I'm not entirely convinced that the screwdriver is worth $70, but considering how long I expect it to last (as opposed to my old $20 screwdriver, which is still going strong and which I still use), it's probably a reasonable investment."
I’ve been watching a lot of your YouTube videos and I always wondered how your screwdriver felt. My old screwdriver had finally broke so it was time to test it out. I’m very pleased. The ease that this does its job is amazing and the hidden compartment for the bits is also appreciated. Haven’t lost a screw yet with the strong magnet. LTTstore.com

"I already owned a few ratcheting screwdrivers before, but I must say this one is by far the best. The ratchet is super tight, love the sound and the bit storage. The only thing missing is a other texture on the handle, so the grip would be better."
"This one has it all, a storage compartment for extra bits, a reversable ratcheting handle, great grip, excellent color options, and great durability!  Thank you LLT team for designing and producing such a great product!"
"It's great. Nice weight, awesome action - worth every Swedish krona!"
"Awesome. The ratchet is so precise, feels weighted so nicely, basically no rattle, works like a dream"
This is the best ratcheting screw driver I've owned. Only slight downside is the handle could use a bit more grip to make it easier when working with gloves on.

"A top quality,  well made ratcheting screwdriver that lives up to the LTT name. I highly recommend this product."
"Great product, took a while to get here but then I am in Australia. I like the solid build quality."
Good screwdriver. Wish that it came with some torx and not hex and also wish there was so more grip on the handle.
Everything perfect as reviewer said only thing the bit holder is a bit too stiff but I'm sure it will lose over time so it's perfect as it is
I've never been terribly handy but I feel that I could be with this awesome screwdriver. I'm looking forward to the day I need it.

Superior product
"I'm constantly looking for reasons to use this screwdriver. It's a pure joy to use it and is so efficient compared to standard screwdrivers, but also cheaper ratchet models. The only thing it might be lacking sometimes is that the diameter of the bits holder is too thick to reach into deeper screw holes/crevices - that however goes for any bit driver, so it's not a fault of LTT. Now i just need the stubby model as well, preferably in the Noctua design!"
So far loving it. Haven’t needed to use it much since I got it but I catch myself randomly fidgeting with it. Feels very high quality and I love the pop and snap of the storage compartment. Will say I did pinch my finger in it but thats just user error. Highly recommend and IMO worth the price
"It sits in a Goldilocks position for medium sized projects and builds, but not all our carpentry work or home improvement. It does what it's meant to do well!"
I have four ratchet screwdrivers and there was always something that they lack and I couldn’t identify what. After buying the ltt screwdriver WOW. THE SMOOTH handling and ease was unbelievable. Not heavy even with the bits loaded in the handle. The reght size in my hand. No rough handle. Using one hand to insert and turn a screw is so easy. This is what I needed all along. Thanks Linus.

A driver. A screwdriver. 
"I own 1 and have bought 1 as a gift.  I also have the stubby, and someone else in the family has one too.  These things are great. I've used it to tune carburetors, build PCs, wire lights, install appliances, tighten door hinges, and fix all other kinds of things.  The ratchet is great, the bits work well, and I appreciate the half size so I can add more bits in the handle.  These are great to give as gifts too.  I plan to buy a few more within the next year."
I have the original all black shaft and orange and black original one and it is amazing and I loved it and I needed another one for job reasons so I figured I'd buy a new one for home and take the old one to work. Amazing screwdriver but the box came damaged And flattened looking so I'm a bit disappointed at that cuz I love boxes
"I was using a Kobalt ratcheting screwdriver for a while and since it was the only one I've ever owned, I had no idea that the back-force on a driver was so important. If nothing else, that minor annoyance is officially gone! Mostly it's just a great fidget toy at my desk but it does work fantastically at its real job too"
"This product is the best screwdriver I have used. It feels good in the hand, has a deeply satisfying ratchet mechanism, comes with standard bits to cover most day to day screw driver needs, and is well built."

"Quality is top tier, better than most other brands. Only downside is cost, especially as an Australian. Basically costs almost double to the USD."
After using my personal ltt driver for over a year in tasks relating from motorcycle maintenance to electronics disassembly to hospital equipment repair. I have to say that this is an excellent product.
"The shipment has finally arrived, but unfortunately, it's been a letdown. Upon inspection, the screwdriver package seal was open, and the tool inside seemed far from new – with visible dust and noticeable scuff marks. While I expected some wear over time, receiving a visibly used item after a two-month delay is Disappointing . Overall, not a satisfying experience. 🤦‍♂️"
Your product is incredible.
"I held off buying this driver even though I'm a big fan of the channel. I decided to bite the bullet and purchase one. The build quality seems great IMO. The bits stay in the end. It has a good, strong magnet. It's easy and quick to swap between different bits. The ratchet is so smooth and satisfying I play with it like a fidget spinner. The bit storage pops shut with a very satisfying sound and opens easily while remaining closed when it's supposed to be. It feels great in the hand. It makes repairs around the house or system building a breeze. The knurled shaft is great for seating longer fasteners or when you need a light touch. I can't say enough about how great this screwdriver is. I simply love it!"

Poor customer service. Terrible shipping. 2 months to get my order.
My main for pc building. I put a fan in and I thought I was the coolest tech guy around.
"My Grandson wanted this for Christmas. I thought it was too expensive for just one screwdriver, but my Grandson knows his tools, and this is what he asked for, so I assume he knows the quality. I don't mind paying a little more for good quality.  a\nHe was a very happy camper when he opened his gift."
Hands down best screw driver I've ever used for PC building and even diy. Absolutely love it worth every penny.
"It is the perfect complement to my Craftsman bit set, and the ratcheting shaft is a great fidgeting tool."

"This screw driver came the same day that I traded my MacBook for a new desktop on fb marketplace. Unfortunately the guy I traded with was not trustworthy and I had a bad motherboard.. well this screwdriver came just in time for me to do a lot of diagnostic work taking out and putting back different components.. found the one slot on the motherboard was bad. After that ordered a new one and got to test the strength of the bits putting in Mobo screws. I did not know I needed this until i tried it. After that I got my bathroom and bedroom retiled and got new furniture, this screwdriver was perfect for putting this stuff together and not fatiguing my hand.. usually I would use an impact gun but with particle board I didn’t want to damage anything.. overall 10/10 I just want you guys to make a 6/1 non-ratcheting screwdriver so I can get one for work"
"The LTT screwdriver before I got it seemed, frankly, basic; It had all the usual gimmicks of a ratcheting screwdriver from any hardware brand. However, I watched the creation video behind it and was quite blown away! The thought and detail behind it were magnificent. I decided to pick up the white and purple edition when it came out to see if it held up. Truly . . . this thing is a damn masterpiece of its class. Every part is intricately made, near-seamless, and everything is buttery-smooth. The ratchet works better than a Swiss watch, every color is clean and un-smeared, and the bit holder almost feels like it springs out for how \""poppy\"" it is. I honestly love it, and if you're thinking of getting one but are debating the price, watch the build-vid until you imagine all the neurons Linus lost in the process. "
"This is the best screwdriver I've every used, and also serves as my new favourite desk fidget toy."
"I have over 40 screwdrivers in my collection of tools, but only one is used in every project. That’s the LTT screwdriver. "
Would rate 6 out of 5 if possible

These drivers are SOLID and I’m not even saying it from a fanboy’s point of view. Being an automotive technician I handle expensive and cheap tools on the daily this driver does not disappoint and is well worth the price. Can’t wait to see what other collaborations come out!
Never thought in my life I’d buy a $70 screwdriver but here we are. I absolutely love it. It comes with me everywhere I go and works great. Plan on buying future color ways and maybe some for my family members!
"bought this screw driver for a good time, screws good for a yankee screw driver. it is actually quite good quality. so are the cloths i bought, all very good quality.. i was buying stuff originally just to support LTT but upon receipt i am very pleased that the quality of materials coming out at LTT is quite good, minus the Linus jokes, kappa."
"Love the product, just got my third one in the mail gifted the other two to friends and family.... Had to buy on last to keep for my self ... Will recommend!"
"Wonderful screwdriver, a bit pricey, but wonderful features and great quality. Color was spot on"

"My husband seems to really like this screwdriver. The color, feel, and function are all high quality. He specifically mentioned that he likes that the racheting function is opposite that his other racheting screwdrivers. He is a trades person and with that in mind he told me that he believes that this screwdriver is best kept at home for computer work, etc. rather than field work."
"While I've yet to use this for working on PCs, it's come in remarkably handy as I've recently moved. Its perfect grip and ratchet mechanism easily handles assembling furniture, hanging shelves, etc. This assures me that it will easily handle the less rugged work of any PC building/maintenance. While I have a power drill, there are many jobs that a manual screwdriver just performs better and I am extremely pleased with my purchase."
Great screw driver ratchet works really well
Nice
"This screwdriver makes every screw a dream to use, and it’s really nice to have all the bits on it already!"

I bought it on black Friday. One because it was retro coloured and I loved the style. Two because I love having a good tool I can rely on.
"I haven't yet had a chance to use it in active duty much, but first impressions are great! I am concerned about the bit holders breaking over use or with drops, however I'm considering that as a part of life since most if not all multibit screwdrivers have that as their weakness. The texture on the shaft is really useful, Linus has good reason to be so excited about it every time he uses one. Bits seem really high quality. I don't know what more to say. I tried really hard to find something better that I can buy locally in Europe rather than pay shipping and taxes on this, in the end, I bought this, and I have no regrets."
"Listen, it's not perfect... but it's pretty good.\nHere's the thing, the ratcheting mechanism is very nice, and the feel of the build quality is very good as well. There were, however, a couple of small things I would have expected to be better."
"Best screwdriver I've owned. Puts together my desk great, and has a decent range of bits to fix stuff around the house."
I work as a low voltage electrician and since I got this thing everyone at my company as asking where I got it at. It 100% makes me faster at my work I haven't found a use case it doesn't work in yet and the feel is the best I've felt with any screwdriver I've had before.

It was a gift for my husband.  He was thrilled.  Everything suited his persnickity self.
It's great!
It’s a great screwdriver and it’s feels amazing in the hand. Has made building PCs more convenient and I’m happy to have something from LTT
I bought the retro screwdriver. The ratchet is really nice and makes diy repairs at home so much easier. The magnet strength is stronger than i’d like at times but easily overcome. Worth the price if you’re actually going to put it to use. The bit storage is really nice and convenient.
Ordered this thing in on Nov 27th on the 12th of Dec it said shipped but no tracking was given. A few days later there was an error on the 21st of Dec customer service finally answered my email and sent out another unit or updated the tracking. I live in the UK but am Canadian where LTT is based. Knowing I would be home for the holidays I ordered this thing with plenty of time. The customer service agent I’ve been dealing with is either on his own or bad at his job. I didn’t get the unit before I had to leave on the 27th. Spent the most money I would ever on a screwdriver that I will not get to use. Could be a great product but the service and fulfilment of LTT is horrific so save you money and don’t buy from them.

"I am a gluten. I have bought the short stubby, both noctuas, and the retro. I've stopped there. The only thing I can say is a the retro is more prone to getting filthy which I thought would be easy to clean and get the nice white to shine again. So far. It has a dingy look but it's still a nice driver. I just wish it had a black shaft. Honestly terms of functionality. I feel in the long term the bit holders are gonna wear down and break eventually. They seem flimsy. Time will tell. Otherwise; great work. And yes. For those who are morbid enough to do the numbers. I did pay over 230+$ on 4 different drivers. I am not ashamed."
Bought as a gift for the boyfie and he loves it.
The best screwdriver I have ever had or used!
"Keep this in the kitchen. Have used for jeep/car projects, appliance repair and everything in-between. Very useful tool. 100% would buy again."
"What is there to complain about? what I bought is exactly what I got... the quality and build is good if not better than expected and its good for its Intended uses... To be honest I just bought it and a specialty set of bits as I needed a y head screw bit because I was trying to fix a specific part of a say electrical device, but I also wanted a good screwdriver for tinkering with my PC as well as any of my future PC builds... Overall everything is good and works well and expect it to last for a many years to come..."

Super high quality and love it so far! I’ve been using it daily since I got it!
"This has been my daily driver for computer and retro gaming repair from the moment I got it. I went for the retro venison, as I hobby in restoring retro systems as well as computer upgrades and repairs. "
Just love it. Have it whit me at work and safe me time and make it easy. So happy i Got it. And all on it is the best and Linus say it work. I Can say yer. For me the best tool i Got. So happy.

"I decided to gift this to my fiancé this year as his Christmas gift. Now, I’m not a tool specialist but I know probably TOO MUCH about this darn screwdriver due to his admiration for the LTT screw & products. We are saving for our wedding so he couldn’t afford to purchase it for himself with us saving. When he opened it up on Christmas Day, he was SO excited while the rest of his family were confused about his love for it. \nNow it’s his go to tool whenever he’s working on projects or his computer. I will admit - that thing is super handy!! Thanks LTT for an amazing product!!"
Almost perfect. If it had other bits like t bits or other common bits it would completely be worth the price.
"Worked on renovating a house for about a year, built two pc's for friends and it served both purposes fantastically. It has screwed in quite literally over 400 screws. The racheting mechanism only slowed down when filled with lots of drywall dust but it worked itself out to its original condition over time. I've used it for more than its intended purpose. A hammer using the plastic end, a punch by hitting it with a hammer, using it to stab through drywall, and using it as a lever and pry. I got the original with the black paint on the knurling and they were right. It has absolutely scratched off back to silver. The magnetic ends have been a huge help to pick up screws. Id say its a good amount of magnetism. Handle is a good fit."
My co-worker has one and I started using it for pc builds here. Instantly bought the retro when it came out. I daily this baby in my IT bag along with the stubby. Overalls the best screwdriver I have ever used and plan to buy another one to keep at home.
This is the second screwdriver I have bought. The first one was for myself; I loved it so much I've come back for a second one as a gift for my dad.

The quality of screwdriver overall is great. The rachet is well designed the force needed is super low and the bit storage is a great use of space and a great additional feature.
"Very nice screwdriver, ratchet is very smooth and low backforce. The storage for the bits is slightly hard to open, but much better than other ones I've had."
"I built my new pc using this screw driver and it started up first try. Maybe it's because I know what I'm doing, or maybe it was the skrew drivers good work... Overall, very good skrew driver, best thing for buidling a pc, and works great around the house as well."
"It took me some time to make my decision about buying the screwdriver. The cost to ship it to Austria was the main reason. But it was definitely worth it.\nThe quality is outstanding, much better than the different screwdrivers I have used before.\nEspecially the magnet feels a lot stronger and the ratchet is perfectly adjusted."
I ordered for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He has used it several times and raves about how good it is.

It finally came!
My fiancé asked for this for Christmas. It is my favorite tool to “Borrow”. It’s really convenient. I have a lot of tools already but this seems to be my go to.
The screwdriver has just met all the expectations set by the lmg team.\nThe ratchet feels awesome and turns so easily its hard to grasp.
"While I haven't had an absurd amount of opportunities to use it, it's very well made, it has a great quality feel to it. The ratchet is so smooth and satisfying to use, it makes me want to find projects to use it on. Plus it's sick that it's SNES colored."
Fantastic screwdriver. The ratchet system is super smooth and I find myself fidgeting with it quite often.  Magnetic tips have saved my rear end more times then I can count.  Well worth the price.

"I do renovations for a living. I added this screwdriver to my daily driver kit. I thought the different bits stored in the back would be slightly inconvenient but it's actually super quick to change them, probably faster than push through styles and I love that they're a little smaller than your standard driver bits because I'm not stealing them and losing them in various power tools. 10 out of 10 would recommend."
Loved mine so much I had to show my father who is a big tool guy. After 10 seconds of holding it I then needed to buy him his own. It’s a great screwdriver.
Most expensive purchase i made for 2023 but it was totally worth it !!! feels nice in hand. solid materials. great texture. great color !!! love it !!!
Great screwdriver it's a little slick honestly. A silicone hand cover can fix that.\nHopefully LTT is working on that.

This screwdriver was definitely worth it the quality of this item is amazing the mechanism works smoothly and the bit holder is so satisfying to open and close I was really impressed with the actual bits strength they can really hold up to some abuse I ordered the retro screwdriver and the black screwdriver and they both had the same quality standards there wasn’t any cut corners or differences of quality between either of them the packaging was also nice and was very friendly to the environment being made of cardboard but still looking and feeling high quality which is nice to see I would 100% recommend this to anyone who is looking for a premium tool :)
The screwdrivers i have owned are usually on the smaller sized ones. Mainly cause i don't really do anything that required something else. Things have changed recently and i have a need to get a bigger one as the smaller screwdrivers are dropping from my hands too easily. Gotta say its the best screwdriver i have ever used but would have liked a better grip. Wouldn't mind more bits that would be included in the purchase considering the price.
"I always thought the screwdriver was nice ever since the first run. I have two coworkers who bought them and I've used them on several occasions. They beat out all the other screwdrivers I've ever personally used. I'm not particularly wealthy so the thought of spending $70 on a screwdriver was not considered lightly. I had accepted that I'll just borrow my coworkers as needed and live vicariously through them! Until... LTT decided to release the Retro color screwdriver.... Once I saw that revealed on WAN show, I went, \""Whelp, looks like I'm buying one. Merry Christmas to me!\"" Haha. I absolutely LOVED the look of it. I've had it in hand for a bit now and used it on various home projects, work projects and hobby projects. I love it. The ratchet is second to none. The weight is really nicely balanced. The knurling has excellent grip. The bits offered by LTT cover all my personal needs for whatever I might need on a whim. If I need more specialty bits then odds are I have my other tools with me and all the other bits I might need but that has only happened once and I don't expect them to make T40 bits. The ease of starting screws is actually a little mind blowing. "
"This is my favorite tool I've ever bought. Just buy it, you won't regret it."
"It took me a long time to finally shell out some money on a fancy screwdriver, I got a Wera, was very happy with it, heard good things about the LTT driver, gave it a shot and unfortunately I am no longer happy with the Wera and have now purchased the normal black with orange accent driver, a stubby with he same color but with the black shaft, a retro driver, an all green I bought for my wife and an all red that hasn't shipped yet. I keep the black and orange in my work tool kit, the retro at the office, the stubby in my backpack and plan on keeping the red at home (don't like moving tools around when I can avoid it). I'm decked out at this point, probably don't need more, but I would be interested if there were more colors (thinking mostly something like the all black with orange accent version but with other accent options) and would probably buy more if black shaft was an option (even with the wear issue that has been advertised). All that said, great screwdriver, would recommend to all."

Wonder if was a birthday present the person loves it uses it constantly 🤗\nI lovey retro driver as well ! Keep up the good work LTT AND CREATOR WEARHOUSE 🥳
There hasn’t been one person that I have let use my LTT Screwdriver that hasn’t immediately asked me for a link to buy their own. Working on computers or in server racks this thing stands out from the other drivers. The ease of starting screws is no joke and the magnet is nuts. I have 2 and will continue to buy more to keep anywhere I could use one! Crushed this one LTT.
It’s everything I expected it to be I like the design and how smooth it turns one handed
i got to say after owning now different different screwdrivers ( original black shalf version i use at work and retro for home ) i got to say they are great and oh so oddly satisfying to use. just wish you could order all the extra bits together.
Bought as a Christmas gift and had to get one for myself. Ratchet is shockingly satisfying.

Great screwdriver. Great fidget toy too haha. 
Bought this as a gift to my Dad as he still had a single screwdriver from the 90s. He was very happy and used it to build all the presents he could.
I made the decision to replace my multitude of cheap and nasty tools with a small number of good quality and dependable ones. 
"Great product, but my package didn't ship until a month after I ordered it. Maybe it was the holidays, but I definitely expected better timing than that."
I bought this screw driver for my husband.  He loves it.  Best Christmas gift.

"The ratchet lives up to the hype, and the strong magnet has already come in super handy finding and retrieving rogue screws that bounced away from me."
Great ratcheting screwdriver with a good selection of bits. Works great on helicopters.
"Loved this screwdriver, had to buy a second after my first was stolen. Best ratchet screwdriver I have ever used in my career."
"It was a decent screwdriver. Construction is ok, not as good as I expected for the price. I mostly bought this to support LTT. The plastic of the handle is cheaper feeling than expected. I feel like if I had it longer, under heavier use it might have cracked if it was subjected to repeated impacts like being dropped."
"Other than being a nice quality product, it is a great tool that I did not know I needed until I had it. I’m a power tool person, or at least I thought. But this baby worked very nicely in various situations in the last couple of weeks and now it is with me wherever I go. \nI also liked it as a fidgeting toy as well and I only give it four stars as it tends to jam time to time if I spin it fast. It is might be a bit harsh but 5 stars would mean perfect, right? :)"

It is a high quality ratcheting screwdriver that is premium in both aesthetics and function. Absolutely love it.
"Bought four, one regular and one stubby each for SysAdmin consultant me and for carpenter dad. No complaints. I could lift my hammer (6oz/450g) with the magnet bit."
I have been using it for about 2 weeks without any problems. Magnet is really strong for all kinds of work. Works well for home usage as well as dealing with electronics. \nVery Happy with the purchase
Great quality. Best screwdriver ever

Feels good in the hand and has replaced all my screw drivers
Great little driver! My three complaints / thoughts for improvement are:\nthat the ratchet direction selector is to easily switched (it needs a stronger spring on the balldetent) I find myself accidentally turning it during regular use.\nI also wish the centre position where the driver doesn’t ratchet was easier to find.\nLast of all I feel like an aluminum handle with knurling would feel more premium and be an option I would be willing to pay extra for. It would also give me more grip in the wet and cold. I am a marean electrician and there nothing worse then being up a mast or on a super structure with cold and wet hands and not having  good grip on the smooth plastic of the driver. I had to apply grip tape to my driver to mitigate this
"Feels high quality, which I’d expect for the price. I have not used yet though."
"Greatish screwdriver I spent the better part of 2023 buying multi screwdrivers because I use them a lot and leave stuff behind so makes sense to have multiples and most aren't $70 but I can respect the time it takes to make a good product and that's what I got for my money, this one was better than most, great bits, satisfying click of the ratcheting mech very fun to play with and ive put some good torque on it with no issues. My few complaints are the slop in the shaft in and out and left and right its noticeable when you're taking tips in and out not really an issue but annoying on a $70 screwdriver, the left to right slop is more concerning if it gets any worse, also the bit holder isn't centered at all spinning it while the out position makes an awful scratching noise. Id like to buy the stubby driver but at this price I can't really justify it if I'm going to see the same issues."

"Screwdriver is great feels good in my hand, and ratcheting mechanism is super satisfying. My only complaint is that the store won't let you select which bit set it comes with, it always comes with standard."
One of the best looking screwdriver I ever owned. High quality built...Highly recommend to everyone who is looking for a quality product.
"I ordered this over a month ago with other items and the delivery is screwed up and I still haven't gotten it, an am missing some presents for Christmas.  Shipping isn't cheap, this is extremely disappointing"
I work in a data center and use this every day. I don’t have to lug around a bag of tools just reach for my trusty LTT.
"This screwdriver is cool, it would be dope if they sent me a second one for my other hand"

Great driver 10/10
This has been one of my best purchases in the last year. Hands down.
I got the old school colorway and it looks and feels amazing. I've replaced a bag of bits and drivers and I'm able to keep everything I need in the handle of this one. LTT products are manufactured and designed with much care and love. Highly recommend getting one of these.
My son loves this!
Over all the best screw driver I have used.

"Amazing screwdriver, the colors are on point and the functionality makes it all worth the money. Very satisfying mechanism for bit storage, easy ratcheting force, insanely magnetic bits and driver."
"I have over a dozen of these type screwdrivers, including Snap-on, Williams, Mac Tools, Wera, etc…….and this LTT Screwdriver is my favorite mainly because of weight, size & fit. I wish it had more orange coloring so it’s more visible on the Jobsite and a holster or belt clip. I’m glad the shaft is bright silver and the knurling is a nice feature.  It’s almost perfect. Thanks"

"I love thus screwdriver so much, only thing is the bits ger scratches up and the paint comes off, they could've left it silver"
Great quality!
I already knew what I was getting myself into when I got the fabled LTT screwdriver. So it's no surprise how quality this tool genuinely is! Is it pricy? Yes.. Is it honestly worth it to have a high quality tool for everyday use? YES
"I had my first one stolen at the job site I'm working at and I liked it so much that I bought a second one. I really like how easy the ratchet is to use, especially when I'm trying to get a screw started on a cover plate where the Jbox it is screwing into is recessed behind 2 layers of 3/4inch drywall."

"Use this all the time since I got it. I install and repair EPOS equipment, and use various different bits regularly. The 12 bit holder makes a big difference. (Loaded out with the standard and hex set.)"
I wish the standard bit set would've included Torx bits. It would've also be great if it is electrically insulated but I imagine that would've come with a whole lot of difficulties.\nOther than that it's perfect
This is the best screwdriver I've ever used! It has a great feel in the hand with the perfect set of bits. I use the flathead bits as box cutters! Very versatile! There is a tiny bit of wobble in the shaft but its only noticeable when fidgeting.
"This screwdriver is great for taking apart desktop computers and other light work, the first time I used is on putting furniture together and working on my car, the bits start losing their coating and I kind of feel the ratchet is going to break."
One of the best purchases I've made this year

I have a couple ratcheting screwdrivers\n(Snap-on & matco) and used many other brands. This is by far the best of them all! And for the people that say its over priced haven't bought a snap-on or matco screwdriver from a tool truck haha! 
It's overpriced but it's the best screwdriver I've ever used
Birthday present for husband (only likes LTT these days). Delivery time to uk was excellent and the product is high quality and really good value. I got him all the bit sets and he dived straight in today using it. Honestly love the quality of all LTT products.
I've used a lot of tools in my time and this has to be one of the best designed and sturdy tools.
I love it. Didn't think I would say first do to price. But honestly it's the best screw driver I've ever owned and or used.

"I’m a general contractor/electrician/electronic enthusiast and I absolutely love this screwdriver, I’ve beaten the hell out of it and it still works as great as the first day I got it. 10/10 would recommend!"
No comments. Perfect is every way.
"Hab das Teil importiert, weil ich beruflich viel schraube. hab es nun etwas mehr als 3 Wochen im Einsatz und bin soweit ganz zufrieden. Alles sehr leichtgängig und macht einen hochwertigen eindruck.\ndie schwarzen bits verlieren sehr schnell ihre beschichtung, aber das ist normal. der magnet macht seinen job richtig gut. mit dem ist mir noch keine schraube rausgefallen. Der preis ist allerdings nicht in ordnung, wenn man den import nach deutschland einrechnet, aber das kann ich LTT Store nicht vorwerfen.\nmeine einzige sorge bei einer langzeitnutzung sind die kleinen bit-halterungen, der erste wird schon \""weich\"" wenn ich das mal so sagen darf. aber solange es hält, kann ich hier auch keine abzüge machen."

"Wonderful construction and elegant design. I just keep coming back to these, so I've nearly replaced every screwdriver in my life with these by now..."
"I've been using it for a while now and this is a very good screwdriver, the magnet and the bit storage are huge improvements over the ratcheting screwdrivers I've used in the past. I don't know if I would absolutely say it's worth $70, though I understand Linus/Creator Warehouse are a lot smaller than the big name tool companies, don't enjoy the same economies of scale, so I don't want to rag on them too much.\nI do wish I had held off for the retro color scheme, though it's not like it was even announced at the time I bought this one."
"This is my first ratcheting screwdriver and boy is it good. Super low back pressure, the knurling on the shaft and in handle bit storage are the highlights for me. Outstanding to keep in my ute and use around the farm."
Worth it
"I’m not much of a tool person, but do often find myself in a position where I need a screwdriver on short notice or while away from home. I was hesitant about the price of the LTT screwdriver, but thought I’d give it a go to support one of my favourite creators/teams."

Best dang screwdriver my boyfriend has ever had
I'm in love with this screw driver not only is the rachet function so nice the different head bits and the magnet stand up to all the praise everyone at work asks to borrow it constantly and it's replaced my other screw drivers at home too
"The screwdriver is INCREDIBLE. It is by far the best screwdriver I have used for any applications. The ratchet mechanism is EXTREMELY smooth, the bit storage moves nicely once it's broken in, and the magnet has proven itself useful time and time again. I would recommend this screwdriver to everyone."
Good quality product with fantastic UX - finally somebody thought about what the user actually wants :)
"This is a fantastic product. I had seen it in so many videos and finally put my order in to go with my first PC build. Really premium product, couldn't be happier with it. Thanks to all involved with it's development!"

"Good, quality construction with a solid weight to it; combined with its low ratchet torque makes it effortless to use. Also the REALLY strong magnet is super useful (no more shaking my computer upside down to reach a loose screw )\nI’ve recommended to family members and would recommend to anyone that uses a driver often!"
"The mechanism is very smooth sounding and has really low backdrag, it sounds like and clicky too. The selection ring is stiffer than i anticipated but i got more used to it after a little bit of just messing around with the end cap. The knurling on the shaft is pretty convenient to use it when you hold it as shown in their video discussing the driver, over all happy i got and looking forward to build up my next computer with it."
"Great screwdriver, super smooth and easy ratcheting. Would recommend to anyone who uses a driver often."
Took awhile but it’s awesome quality exactly what you expect
"Love, love, love this screwdriver! Thank you LTT! Never thought I'd need a tool like this. It has come in handy so many times. I keep it in my work bag and it goes with me everywhere. It's really nice having the bit storage in the top. Everything about this screwdriver is satisfying to use. The quality is very good and the ratcheting mechanism is so smooth."

Just recently I have been making a lot of 3D printed files and even upgrading a said 3D printer and it has worked flawlessly. Honestly, I am glad that this is my first tool that I own. That is not lend from someone else. It feels great in the hands and I'm even considering buying More tool bits that will fit it. You guys are doing amazing work. And I wish you for the best."
"At almost 130 dollars Canadian after shipping to London, Ontario. It costs too much for what you receive, don’t get me wrong, it’s a solidly built screw driver."
Nothing crazy new about this screwdriver but it is very well made and all of the different aspects are perfect for someone who wants one go to screwdriver on their tech bench. Bits are always with it and comfortable to use.
I didnt get to use the screwdriver very much but everytime i used it it really helped me and felt perfectly balanced in my hand.

"Absolutely fantastic, genuinely the best screwdriver I have ever used in my life, M it might seem expensive but trust me it’s worth every penny"
"Look, its a solid screwdriver- the magnets offered are fantasticly strong, it does take standard bits even if you cant find the 1/2 sized ones anywhere else, if you're not using it a lot it will basically be a fidget toy (which it also is fantastic at) had what I can only assume is the ratchet slip once or twice when *really* quickly chaning direction but thats probably just how ratchet screwdrivers go about things you know. If you need a screwdriver it'll do you right- maybe throw it in with something else you're ordering because delivery is still delivery, either get some bits at the same time or buy some cheap ones from a more local source"
"The shipping, handling and just kills you."
"This screwdriver came with me on 3 out of state trips to install networking gear and workstations. One of the guys helping me out didn't bring any tools so I ended up having to let him borrow this occasionally, and whenever he had it I felt overprotective! Strong enough to screw in an 80-pound UPS while holding it up with the other hand, can change the ratchet direction easily with one hand and the magnet is strong enough for just about anything I need. It feels great, looks nice and am asking for a personal one for Christmas to keep in my home office!"
Love the screwdriver

This is the best screwdriver that I've owned. I personally own the all black body and silver shaft version of both the regular and stubby screwdriver. This one with the black/orange body and silver shaft is going to be given away to one of my fellow National Guard Soldiers at our Christmas party this year.

Great Screwdriver. Magnet too strong. Ratchet verry satisfying. Verry good fidget toy. Love the bit storate. Verry good balenced.
Love the screwdriver it ratchets smooth and feels very durable. The bit storage is also very easy to access but doesn't pop out by itself big +. The only improvement for me would be that while the grip's material isn't slippery it does leave some desire for more grip. I would never hesitate to recommend this as a great screwdriver!
"The driver has been solid, its been through some rugid conditions as well as servicing a company in IT, but has held up very well. The only thing I have a problem with was the ratcheting mechanism. Sometimes, without any rhyme or reason will ratchet when its in the locked position. I contacted support and they were quick to respond, offering a replacement that I recieved within the week. Great service and solid quality for anybody who wants a good tool."
"Feels great in the hand, it lives now at the bottom of my non-LTT backpack for when it's needed and it has not disappointed yet.\nSure it's expensive, considering shipping it to Europe, but I hope this lasts many years of light use with my occasional tinkering."
"It works, it feels good in the hands, and it just overall amazing."

"Incredibly low back force on the ratchet makes installing rack mount equipment a breeze. Bite the bullet, it's well worth the money."
Everything I expected it to be. I’ve used it in a few different scenarios and it’s been great. The magnet is super handy!
Bought it to accompany my first pc build and it worked great. Different ways to use it for different scenarios. This is also my first ratcheting screwdriver and I have no complaints whatsoever.
"This is a solid screwdriver , easy to use with a nice solution for the bits , ratchet mechanism works s as you would expect , only negative is I wish they still had the all black metal shaft still"
"Very happy about this, at first it seems like an over priced screwdriver gimmick, Which I was fine with buying because I like buying a Linus tech tips, but it turns out to be my favorite screwdriver I’ve used."

"My son showed me one of these, handing it to me silently, with a smile. My response after spinning it was, \""Ooh! Where do I find it?\"" I bought one of the large ones, and one of the small ones. They are becoming my favourites!"
I gave the screwdriver as a gift to my dad (after I opened it and played around with it!). Good quality and was excited to give it as a gift. I only wish that included in the packaging was maybe a QR code or information on how to watch the LTT videos related to the screwdriver so my dad could see all the cool tech and process behind making the screwdriver.
The ratchet action makes a great fidget toy! I've handed it to a few of my friends and family just to hold and experience and they've enjoyed it too. It might be my favorite trinket in my collection. Oh it's also a good screwdriver.
Great rachet action! Very thoughtfully designed.
"Just got mine and have already put it to use multiple times - works great as a companion to a smaller screwdriver as this one is quite large, which makes it comfortable to hold and very durable. Happy with my purchase and look forward to using it more around the house. Thanks!"

"I am happy with the screwdriver. The knurling is surprisingly useful.\nIt was not clear to me, that the screwdriver comes with the standard set of bits so I ordered another one and now I have two. However most of the bits are pretty useful so I will find use for them."
It is solid and has a good feel - particularly the ratchet and direction selector. The bit storage is fiddly - I think I prefer the long double-ended design employed in some other drivers. The bits are so short that most recessed screws are unreachable with it because the shaft won’t fit down the hole. So I always need another screwdriver to hand as well 🤷‍♀️.
"Handle is really nice too hold, not as slippery as I thought. Magnet is strong, I don't drop screws anymore now"
"I was first from my group of friends who purchased this screwdriver, everyone knew about it but it was \""expensive\"" for them, since then I am not alone that have this amazing tool. Can recommend. Oh yeah the bits are amazing too"
"it's a lil expensive but easily the most comfortable screwdriver I have used for anything. The\nbit storage makes a really satisfying sound and feels great. I wish it was just a weency bit easier to pull the bits out of the drive, but that's a minor gripe."

"This is an awesome screwdriver! I've used a lot of different ratcheting screwdrivers, and this is one of the best! I love the bit storage, and the backdrag."
Hands down one of the best screwdrivers I have ever purchased.  I hope they come out with more color options like green or maybe glow in the dark. The price was up there for a ratcheting screwdriver but it is the quality that is the reason. Great job!
"I'm surprised at the texture. As a sweaty boy, most drivers generally slip off my hands but this one doesn't."
Lives up to the hype.
Amazing screwdriver!

Perfect in every single way. Fast shipping too.
"Was in the market for a new ratchet screwdriver and this one ticks all the boxes. Payment and shipping was straightforward and quick. Form factor is comfortable, ratchet is smooth and very easy to turn, good but storage, and integrated magnetic tip. Overall a solid upgrade from my old screwdriver. Been using it at work daily (electronic and small system repairs) for the last month and it still performs as good as day 1. I expect to get many good years of use out of this thing."
"I got the screwdriver as a gift from a Canadian friend. He brought it to me to Romania, but the bit holder was coming out. I wrote support and they sent me a new one TO ROMANIA at no extra cost. At this point everyone knows the screwdriver is great, but you can rest assured if for whatever reason something goes wrong, these guys will take care of you."
"I don't work on computers much at all but I've used this a bunch around the house. The strong magnet + ease of driving one-handed makes it my go to. I kinda wish it could store normal length bits but the size of the driver + magnetic pull is nice. My only complaint is the price, hopefully it'll lower well with time."
"i love my ltt screwdriver from lttstore.com! i've used it for building pcs and furniture and it's held up great. my only complaint is the black bits get the paint taken off pretty fast, i wish they were just silver. but that's just aesthetic"

its a screwdriver.  it screws.  jobs a goodun.
This screwdriver is just amazing! Super versatile. I love the strong magnets.
Its good but I don't have alot of good to say about it. Its a screwdriver it's well built and feels nice. While free spinning in hand (did it alot) couple of times rachet had crunchy feeling. I really don't see why handle couldn't be 15mm longer so that regular bits would fit.
The screwdriver it’s self it’s fantastic wish there was a case to carry it with the extra bits
Nothing much to say. I've had no issues with it! I will say: the handle is great and I like the storage design!

"Easily the best screwdriver I have ever used. The ratchet feels and sounds fantastic, the handle feels comfortable, everything about it is great. Definitely worth the money. (Overseas price is a bit bad though)"
Everything about the screwdriver from the feel to it's performance is perfect for our workplace and crew.\nWe look forward to future offerings and will recommend it to anyone who asks. Thanks for the speedy service as well.
"No complaints, works as advertised, the only decent ratchet driver I've used, IMO"
"This screwdriver has become my absolute favorite, hands down. Even though I encountered a defect nearly 11 months post-purchase, my experience with LTT support was nothing short of exceptional. They promptly sent me a replacement. I now carry this screwdriver with me at all times. The level of customer service at LTT is exemplary and something other companies could definitely learn from and strive for."
I love it. Feels good in the hand. Ratchet very smoothly and the low Ratchet click force makes one hand uses a breeze. Has a very strong magnet that holds on to the bit and the screw.

"I have used the screwdriver for a long time. In that time I have used it for 4 PC builds, One datacenter rack (42U) assembly of new servers, disassembly of 3 datacenter racks (42u) and jobs around the house."
Good product. Good service.
Love the screwdriver. One of the most satisfying tools ever. My first screwdriver had an issue where the bit holder came out. LTT Support was very helpful and quickly and efficiently replaced my screwdriver.
"My husband is obsessed with this screwdriver!! Great quality and so easy to use, he recommends it to everyone!"

"I have been searching for a BIFL racheting screwdriver for a while and finally pulled the plug on this one. I have loved it so far, especially the little amount of backforce needed"
"Super happy with the performance and the quality so far. Also hands down one of the best customer service I had to deal with, quick and efficient.\nOnly downside is the shipping to Europe, it get very expensive."
"I ordered 3 screwdrivers and looks like each of them comes from different batch. Colors are slightly off on the last one, plus the mechanics seams to be less precise than the first one ordered few months ago."
"I had been thinking for a quite a while before buying this screwdriver for quite a while, given I live in Europe, the shipping cost is hefty and the delivery takes quite some time. With that added I believe I've got a great value while supporting a creator I watch daily. The screwdriver is mint, already got me through a rack job with flying colours and assembly of furniture for the missus, both cases It was a pleasure to use. Colleagues of mine also taken notice and they really liked the feel of it. As I see the previous comments there is a small rattle of the shaft given the nature of the screwdriver when shaken. I'm compared it to others and I would say this still takes the cake. It's really rigid, I believe it's gonna be take quite some time before I wear it down. So much so I will probably source a backup one shortly. Hopefully when the Phillips head set is back in stock."
I love it I use it every day for appliance repair my only complaint about it is the shaft on the driver makes a little noise (not the ratcheting mechanism) it’s like a small popping noise but other than that it is great and I love it

"This screwdriver is grade A quality. It can driver a screw into a stud. It help replace parts in electronic. It comes with a magnetic head, so it can even be used to make a small hand crank generator. \n**These claims are not verified by anyone of importance. They have not been evaluated by representatives of Canadian or United States authority. Before using the magnetic tip as a generator please consider standard electrical safety.**"
"For years, I was using the wretched ratcheting screwdriver that came with a cheap computer repair kit, and I hated to use it. Now, with the LTT Screwdriver, screwing is the highlight of my day!"
"I don't typically spend a lot of money on screwdrivers. However, after getting mine, I also one of these for everyone in my department. My coworkers were skeptical, \""How great can a screwdriver be?\"" now its the first one they reach for. The ratcheting mechanism is extremely satisfying and the bit storage is perfect for my needs. I purchased the Stubby version as well and I am not disappointed. I'm excited to see how their precision and fixed shaft screwdrivers turn out."
I'll be sticking to ifixit kits for more delicate work and cheap no-name screwdrivers for more destructive situations but the super easy clicks are perfect for PC building as advertised!
"I was a big fan of the 'black and yellow' brand until 3 of 5 screwdrives broke in a less than a year... I got LLT one and can't even express how happy I am. I love the strenght of the magnet and convenience of the bit holder/storage, amazing ratchet and super balanced weight. Waiting for the noctua design, not because I am a big noctua brand lover but I need a light colored body for my workshop to be able to easy to find the 'lost' tool in a pile of other tools around. 10/10 stars for this product!"

"I use it everyday at work and it's perfect for my use, I dropped it many times and it's still in perfect condition. "
Best Screwdriver I've ever had.. by far.
"Thank you so much for the screwdriver and bottles.My boyfriend has been wanting it for a very long time. After getting it for him,he won’t let it go. We are currently on vacation and he took it with us. Absolutely loving it is an understatement.. Bottles are also very good. Thank you again!"
"I wanted to try the LTT screwdriver, to see if the hype was justified. Great product. I love specifically the care of the details (awesome magnet, comfortable handle, great ratchet mechanism, good materials). It is not the cheapest screwdriver on the market, but in the end I think it is a good compromise. You need an higher price if you want all the little things working really well."
"Its a little pricey, so it wont be for everyone. That being said, it feels great to use, seems solid so far, and I'm happy with my purchase."

"The LTT screwdriver, both normal and shorty, are very well made precision instruments. The mechanical action is smooth as silk and the tool bits work extremely well. Overall, it has to be one of the best tools I have ever purchased."
The screwdriver holds up well. I liked it so much that I bought another one for my dad for Christmas so he will stop borrowing mine.
"This thing is such a fantastic little tool, I take it everywhere even just to fidget with the rachet. Honestly, I now find myself looking for odd jobs to do around the house just so I can use this thing. I figured the novelty would have worn off by now, but still enjoying it just as much as the day I got it. Well done Linus and team!"
"I've used this screwdriver daily and it has worked like the first day. The build quality, balance, and grip are great. Very good value!"

I legitimately come up with projects just to use this. It works well for changing light switches (make sure the power is off) and of course works for computers as advertised. The ratchet is so smooth and I find myself reaching for it for everything. The magnet also works phenomenal and hasn’t let a screw fall off yet.
Gave the driver to my brother for his birthday and he loved it.
This is the best screwdriver I have ever used. The bit storage and racketing mechanism lead it to being an easy to use screwdriver that effectively gets any task done.
Great screw driver with a smooth low slip ratchet drive.
Don’t let the price dissuade you. Incredibly versatile and easy to use.

"I work as a toy maker and my family's IT, and it's nice to have every bit I need tucked away inside the handle. I never leave home without it."
"I’m in auto mechanics as a trade and pc building/electronic repairs as a job and hobby. This is one of the best screw drivers I’ve used. Up there with the top of the tool truck offerings in the states. I got one at home, work, and in my backpack. I’ve lost count of the times it’s literally saved someone’s day. Quality is great. Invaluable to have."
"This is the best thing that I've ever gotten myself or anyone. For the savvy user or just a handy-dandy screwdriver that can do it all. Build quality couldn't be better. Plus, somebody from their team complimented my setup which made the whole thing even better! Thanks LTT!"
"This thing is amazing , I have used it for pretty much everything that did not require me to twist with a ton of force. The only downside is i got one a week before they announced that the different colors and the cold press did not effect its quality lol if i had waited a week i would have gotten a color one lol. Other then that this is worth the price. Thank you for taking your time in getting this screwdriver to the quality it is at."
"The moment I laid my hands on the LTT screwdriver, I was instantly drawn to long, smooth shaft and ample hand grip. It felt like a fine caress in my soft technician hands. This screwdriver boasts a versatile range of attachments, and I have to admit, I worry that I have not given them all the attention they deserve.\nOverall the ratchet.....ratchets and the driver screws so I guess that is all a NZ lad can ask for."

I use screwdrivers a lot for work and have for 20+ years now. Both the full size and stubby LTT drivers are great. They have become my daily drivers (lol) and are a joy to use. Yes it is a lot of money for a screwdriver but it really is a premium item and one of those buy-once-cry-once tools for the kit.
"I really enjoyed using this screwdriver right away, but how much I appreciate the design and quality truly stood-out to me when my internal voice started saying \""eww\"" when I have grabbed a different screwdriver for something."
"I recently acquired this screwdriver and was genuinely impressed by its quality. However, a couple of points to note: firstly, because of its loose packaging, it got some marks from rubbing inside the box during shipping. Secondly, after a month of use, I noticed the selector tends to shift slightly off-center. Despite these issues, the support team was quick to address my concerns. Overall, it's a solid tool, but there's room for improvement in packaging and the selector's durability."
Its Amazing! The feeling so smooth with Some lube. No just kidding the best ever!
"Everything from the construction, material/build quality, hand feel, tight consistent ratcheting…it becomes a joy just holding the damn thing looking for any excuse to use it.  "

"Works great, feels nice.\nSince my days screwing with foreign PCs are luckily over, I use it for my hobbies like 3d printers, electronics, cars...\nIt's nice to have the bit always near, but I still struggle on the perfect loadout, which is totally my personal problem ;)"
"I've had a few different screwdrivers mast of them from the truck companies, and a few from the big box stores. The quality of the materials are superb and the Ratchet is tighter than even my MAC driver set. And the bit storage is by far the better design."
I bought my first screwdriver when it was initially launched. Black with silver shaft. I love it so much I wanted another one for upstairs. Plus I wanted a stubby as well. I waited until the release of the stubby and decided to get a 2nd non-stubby as well. I ordered a black and orange with silver shaft this time. So amazing. I’m getting my best friend one for Christmas too.
"Its an expensive screwdriver,  but its cheaper than buying a bunch of cheaper screwdrivers which I ended up doing over the years. So if you only want to buy 1 screwdriver buy this one, its pretty great and it seems like its going to last but my only question is whether it will rust when it gets wet because ive gotten other screwdrivers wet and they ended up rusting. And yes screwdrivers end up getting wet when you use them around the house.  Whats really  nice is its magnetic properties, its surprisingly strong."
Initially I was sent a broken LTT screwdriver (incredibly disappointing) but customer service was excellent and they replaced it at no charge. The LTT screwdriver so far has been performing well with advanced ratcheting action...I hope it has durability though given the broken model initially sent to me.

Great screwdriver I got the Balck and orange with and extra bit set of torx bits since I am lightly into pc and laptop repair mostly just home and family used ones recently while upgrading my ssd I shared or stripped the SSD screw that's the only bad experience ive had with this screwdriver rest everything has been smooth sailing I am part of formula Student team and it has also been useful there lot many times
Good tool
"This has been the best screw driver that I have ever owned.  The ratchet, is exceptional!  I am able to just let go of the screw and use the back pressure of the screw to just hold it enough for me to rotate the handle, so I can continue to thread it in.   The bit storage is very convenient, no more trips to the garage to get the right bit.  I have not had any issue with the bits stripping out screws.  My 2 year old ends up stealing it just to spin the shaft, and listen to the ratchet, which I admit is another feature to the screwdriver.  The ratchet mechanism is basically a fidget toy.  If I ever manage to break it I will buy another one."
"My sister is a big fan of Linus, so it was a no brainer to gift her this item; she actually asked for it. Anyway, it is everything and more! She loves it so much! Thanks LTT!"
Great driver snd ratchet with good selection of bits included and amazing options for bit lana’s add ons. Well done team LTT

Ive wanted a ratcheting screwdriver for a while and this was perfect. Bit storage is fantastic and the driver feels great in the hand!
"Quality screwdriver and the bits are nice, the magnet is superb"
I've been using this for mostly electrical type work where this works great. The ratcheting makes it easy to figure out when not to overtighten so that faceplates don't get cracked. It makes unscrewing a breeze as well. The special bits that are included are also nice including the Robertson one.
"I am not a tool guy, I do not tinker much or 'make things' but it is great to have a quality screwdriver that I know will last.\nGreat feel, good weight, ratchet feels good and love the bit storage. \nBeen handy with general furniture setup, adjustments on my 3d Printer and the magnet has been great to keep screws steady while completing little put-together projects with my 4 yo son so he can do it himself.\nNo regrets."

I use it at the office and at home because I'm so happy with the build quality and design. \nTwo other co-workers have also purchased their own for home use after borrowing the one for the office. The magnet has come in clutch multiple times too.
It does exactly as advertised though I'm not sure if I've been using it too hard or something but the ratchet has started binding up every so often and I have to turn it the other way then turn it back to get it to unbind
"Have had great experience with the screwdriver since I got it 2 months ago and it's my goto tool when somethings need to be screwed.\nFor me the price is a bit high due do taxes/import fees, shipping and currency conversion rates since I live in Sweden, but still do feel like it was worth the cost.\nThe only thing I could think of that could be improved is to have a more \""grippy\"" texture on the handle."
Very happy with my screwdriver purchase.  The tool is of excellent quality and is exactly as described in the numerous videos about it - the attention to detail definitely shows in its build quality.  Using this tool is an absolute joy.
Great product. Works as advertised.

I bought it and I did not regnet it. Working as IT Equipment Engineer... Have not thought about features like ratchet etc would help me get my job done faster.
"It has brilliant back force so that the knurling can easily turn screws, thoroughly pleased with my purchase"
"This screwdriver is a game changer. I've used various racheting screwdrivers over the years but ultimately always returned to traditional solid handle drivers due mostly to generally lackluster performance. However, having used the LTT screwdriver for a while now, I have changed my opinion. This is the screwdriver I grab for nearly every application now. I can also speak to the durability of it. I work in agriculture and this screwdriver gets put through a lot while working on irrigation pivots. I've dropped it from 10+ feet onto concrete (not intentionally lol) and the only damage was some slight scarring on the handle. I've put enough torque through it to shear the bit on rusty screws, and it keeps right on working. I can say it also works great for perhaps its more intended purpose, having built my first PC with it (thanks LTT for the tips)."
"This is simply the best overall ratcheting screwdriver I ever used. Took me a long time to order, since its not cheap. \nBut I don't regret it. I am working in service in the electrical transmission industry and actually use it for work. \nThey only issues I have are the sometimes slightly slippery handle and the somewhat fragile bit holders.\nEverything else is great and feels premium."
"Built an ITX PC with it, modded my mouse, love the almost nonexistent back drag! Excellent  build quality, with extremely smooth mechanisms."

Using the LTT screwdriver is an absolute pleasure. Using the ratchet mechanism is truly a God sent making moving back and forth absolutely seamless.
"Yes it's a bit pricey (especially sent to Europe), but f it, it's glorious, it's wonderfully satisfying to fiddle with it. Just get it when you want to blow money on something that just makes you happy."
"I'm a full-time property developer and part-time lover of tech. I often need to fix things using a multibit screwdriver. I've used the Milwaukee one for a while, but switching bits is a pain in the a**. Being a fan of LMG, I was pretty excited when they announced this. Knowing what quality tools cost I wasn't deterred, and I have to say that it has lived up to my expectations. You can use it to fix door handles and then building a pc in a flash. It's versatile and strong. Switching the bits is also a lot of fun. I originally purchased the all black edition. The shaft has since scratched as they knew it would. I still love it. Battle scars."
"Awesome screwdriver, love the feeling. For EU users, the square bits are pretty useless and I would love to see these bits replaced with Pozidrive bits"
"I like the screwdriver. Ratchet works well, selector has a satisfying click, bit container feels like a fidget toy. At first i thought the handle might get slippery since i use it mainly to fix garden/farming machines and tools. But it's been very good and actually it's good that the shaft has no texture. Make cleaning it much easier. Knurling n the shaft is a nice touch and use it quite often. Strong magnet helps a lot as well, i use it pick up other dropped things as well. All in all a excellent product.\nWhy 4 star? i found one Q&A issue on my unit. Not sure if those are just problems with my unit. The bit holder is a little crooked. When i open the bit holder i can see that gap around the base is not event and when it is closed i can feel the gap edge a little bit. Since i live in Europe it's too big of a hassle to send it back to LTT and it's not  a complete deal breaker for me. I wish it was perfect but it's fine."

Better than our Snap on
Bought this to replace an old ratchet screwdriver and is leaps and bounds better then any other I have used.
I absolutely love the weight and feel of the ratcheting action. I work on cars for a living and have used many ratcheting screwdrivers. None were even close to this one. Thanks!
"Honestly, it was better quality than I was expecting. I'm pleasantly surprised, and im looking forward to buying the stubby screwdriver soon."
Great screw driver. You can it's premium when you pick it up. \nI love having it around for house stuff and convince of having all the bits in the driver is nice.\nI can't say I used it too much on the latest computer I build. I still used my trusty be quiet screwdriver with the longer shaft.

I was a little apprehensive at first because of the price and shipping to the UK but I haven’t regretted my purchase at all since getting it.
My son is in IT and wanted this for his birthday. He was super excited! He says it's one of the best tools an IT person can have.
I have just recently bought my first property and as I move in gift to myself I got the LTT Screwdriver. I have to say that it’s been amazing to use and I would definitely recommend it to others as I’m not only a home owner now but a master tinkerer that loves great equipment!
I absolutely love this screw driver. \nEven compared to my previous ratched screw driver that was a Williams which i also consider a good screw driver. This one is better in every way.
"I have four various styles of the LTT screw driver. Three of them arrived fully functional. The fourth (silver shaft, orange accents) arrived with the ratchet gear disengaged and non-functioning. Pushing the shaft in towards the base allowed it to work, however it is still not as smooth as the three others. My newer cold fit (all blue from the limited line) also works without issue, so it was likely just a single weird unit. Overall, I would recommend even my less good unit to someone looking for a screw driver upgrade or replacement. They have been vital to every household repair since the first one arrived."

It is an attractive tool of atmost comprehension . Seldom I have witnessed such craftsmen ship. The shaft is volumes and conforms to the hand like it was created to do so. Hats up good Sirs.
"Have only had cheap ratcheting screwdrivers in the past, the build is chalk and cheese to them. Makes me want to use it.\nHappy with the purchase"
Easy to handle and great ratchet
Good one
"Best screwdriver ever. Ratchet is extremely light, and having the direction selector match the screw rotation makes it a breeze to use. Would love to see torx bits in the standard load out"

"The screwdriver is really good, but a bit expensive. The knurling is nice. It seems very sturdy. The bit storage is the biggest problem i have with it; it does not fit 12 big bits. The body could have easily made longer to accomodate big bits, couldn't it? The INBUS (reputable german brand)  ratcheting screwdriver i have for 30€ does have all the same features and i like the bit storage more; i find it to be easier to use and it fits normal bits. Maybe look at their design and adapt for the next version?"
Best ratcheting screwdriver I have ever used
Fast delivery!!! A+++++
"Do you want to get the best ratcheting screwdriver? This is it. The price is a bit steep, but justified."
"I have nothing bad to say about the screwdriver. It's rugged enough for normal use, the ratcheting mechanism is superb, and it holds all the tips I might need on a daily basis."

"A very nice screwdriver, fits well in the hand. The ratchet function is subtle but effective. Easy to operate.\nSuper nice item!"
It is absolutely amazing!
"Sorry, this is a great screwdriver an all, but $70 for a screwdriver is just absurd... it cost me $100 by the time I had the bits, shipping, and taxes, etc... and it definitely isn't worth that."
Best screwdriver on the market
Good screwdriver overall. The bit storage in the screwdriver handle is really tight and difficult to get bits in and out of. Would recommend if you don't plan to switch bits often and want to support LTT.

"I've been using it here and there for a couple of weeks in a few use cases. Computer build, automotive repairs, and minor house work. Haven't found a failure point yet. Just waiting on my stubby to get here and the precision screw driver to be released."
Been using on my 3D printers and it’s been working great.
"THE SCREWDRIVER IS GOOD BUT VERY EXPENSIVE, THE ORANGE COLOUR SEEN ON YOUTUBE IS DIFFERENT THAN ON THE UNIT\nOVERALL SATISFIED!!"
Wery good
"I know nothing about screwdrivers. I use 'em, things unscrew and it's largely a positive relationship.\nEnter the LTT diamond knurled, mulit-bit storing, magnet embedded, three lobe handled, 221 IN.LBS (22NM) forward torque, perfectly balanced Screwdriver.\nWhile I still know nothing about screwdrivers, I know it's really nice to use."

"I am absolutely loving this screwdriver and constantly looking for projects that I can use it for. I repair a lot of varying things and the only thing I don't like about the screwdriver is that the shaft isn't narrow enough to fit down into recessed screw holes. That only tends to come up one in ten times or so but I have other tools to deal with those situations. I have been enjoying my screwdriver so much that I have been using it in place of my drill in most situations. Thanks so much, I look forward to purchasing more of your products."
worth the money
"I've had this screwdriver for nearly two months now and have been using it very lightly, but I'm impressed!"
"I love it. The direction selector is starting to get stuck. I select a direction, and it changes. I've used it less than half a dozen times. Apart from that, I'm happy. The magnet is excellent, but it is challenging to select the direction; with one hand, I'm holding a switch, and the ratchet won't work. I'll work on it and see if it improves."
"Before purchasing I was put off by all the reviews saying they never received their screw driver. Fortunately, my screwdriver came in on time."

Works great
Great piece of kit
This screwdriver is built excellently and has great quality. I purchased it as a gift for my dad so he has a nice screwdriver to use and it has been great. It is an excellent product and the time and effort put into making this product are evident.
Hard to review a screwdriver that never made its way to my hands. Shame.

"Not that I had many screwdrivers, but this one is really good."
Although this is the best screwdriver I have bought the only problem is that it would come in plastic storage and not cardboard
"I'm a FST for Internet and I use this on every job, eventually useful for wall jacks"
"Absolutely adore this thing, best screwdriver I've ever used. Ratchet is wonderful, adequate bit storage etc. My only issue is the wobbly base, can get a little annoying depending on how I'm using the screwdriver."

"This screwdriver is very good, possibly the best."
"The screwdriver is great until you get the slightest bit of oil/grease on your hands. At that point, the handle becomes utterly useless. If the handle had rubber integrated into it to improve grip, it would be a much better product. The Mac Tools screwdriver set is an excellent example of this. I only wish that that screwdriver had the spinning back cap on it like the LTT one does. Combining these two designs would vastly increase product quality."
"I bought this to tinker on electronics, what it’s real purpose is; but I am an auto mechanic and I’ve actually ended up using it more on vehicles than I have on electronics. Very magnetic! The ratchet mechanism is extremely satisfying, I’d buy it just to play with the ratchet. Feels solid, has some weight which I like."
Good.
"Switched from a small driver & bit kit to this for work, and never miss the a bit kit. Have dropped plenty, and no damage yet!"

"I ordered the screwdriver just before moving. I thought it would be a great test to see, if it is really as good as everybody said it is. I am happy to say that LTT made a genuinly high quality product with the screwdrivers, that is an actual improvement over buying cheaper ones from the local stores in Germany. It's nice to see a product, that really gives you more quality for the higher price. If LTT had a european store and you didn't have to pay taxes everytime you buy something, I would absolutely recommend it to everyone I know and even gift it to others. "
"I have tried several racheting screwdrivers over the years and I generally prefer discrete fixed drivers but this is the first time I feel differently.  The LTT's strength in my view is the ease of switching bits, while feeling tight and light similar to a fixed driver.  I tested it out on a mechanical assembly for work and it made the process easier than anything else I have in my arsenal, and I have a lot of tools.  I may be purchasing more of these for my business.  They are really great."
"The Screwdriver is overall very good, the ratchet mechanism is very fine and light, the included bits are O.K., the feel of the body is very nice, but taken to applications where e.g. oil gets onto it, it becomes a bit slippery.\nIt is a really good product for its inteded usecase (no heavy duty stuff) but not on the cheap side."
"I have five different ratcheting drivers, between home (for general DIY) and work. Overall:"
"I was hesitant to spend so much on a screwdriver but I did. It is one of the best tool purchases i have ever made, super sturdy, smooth and the ratchet is amazing. I'm gonna order another for my office."

"Well designed and made, smooth ratcheting for working with fine computer parts and no wobble in the shaft."
Indeed the best screwdriver ever
"Its a great screw driver and sometimes just find myself playing with the ratcheting system takes very little effort to engage. Mainly use mine for work in the low voltage field, installing and removing wall outlets/ faceplates."
"1. I bought this screwdriver when it was launched as a popup product. I have been loving it ever since. I made a bet with Linus in the lineup that if it felt better than the Wera, I would buy it. The price seemed high at first, because LTT is not an established toolmaker. But after that, I bought many more LTT screwdrivers for personal and business use."
It's a screwdriver. I bought it. It's alright.

"Bought one for home and liked it so much that I got two more, one for work and one for car."
I’ve always had the urge to take things apart. This screwdriver has reinforced that urge. The basic bit set has most commonly used fastener types in mind. The ratcheting mechanism is great doubles as a fidget spinner.
"I never knew how good a ratcheting screwdriver could be, until I used this one. Great stuff"
This screwdriver was a birthday present from my fiancé. She picked out the company colors which I loved because I wanted to support one of my favorite shops. Thank you for making this and I hope to see more! It’s especially useful for my line of work as an IT and because I do work on electronics
God I love the versatility of being able to use both hands for quick screwing. The feel of that ratchet is something else! And the build in magnet is exceptional.

Simply perfect!
"Super great screw driver! I haven't had any problems with it! I saw some reviews explaining if you drop it, the plastic clips holding the bits in place would snap and break. But I have dropped this thing so many times from anwhere from 1-6 feet, and it's held up great! I use this to fix random stuff around the house, and right now im bulding my first rig! super awsome to have! I will say though, the end cap did get a bit loose after putting prussure on it, but that's completly fine if you see the cons vs the pros."
It’s perfect
"it's a good screwdriver, it does what i need it to."
"I daily drive this screwdriver as a professional in the IT space.  It is the best screw driver I have ever used.  I usually have to replace bits every year or so I am unable to judge how these will stand up long term just yet.  Based on the rest of the build quality, I would guess these will be just fine."

"I don't normally purchase stuff overseas with overkill shipping cost. But thanks to the coupon code \""hireddit\"", I finally purchased a screwdriver and other goodies too. Definitely well worth the price and its probably one of my favourite tools that I bring on my daily set."
"You can just tell how passionate the LTT crew is about their screwdriver, and upon arrival you can see why. There's clearly a lot of thought put into this. I love the knurling at the shaft to help start hand tightening screws. Extremely strong magnet. The ratcheting mechanism is so satisfying that I find myself often using it as a fidget toy.  It's a bit pricey but the quality speaks for itself. "
"It's very quality. If you're into tools and getting work done and stuff, it's solid."
"All aspects of the screwdriver are exactly as advertised, no qualms of any sort."
"I enjoy this screwdriver. Almost all of it's selling points are accurate. The one issue I have with it is that the mechanism to change the ratcheting is a tiny bit jank. If you do not fully rotate  it left and right (not talking about the center where it locks), it will cause the ratcheting to be..crunchy? or maybe a little bit of jamming. It's like 1 milometer or less that it causes this. Unfortunately, I am very gentle with a lot of things I own meaning I gently rotate the mechanism. This causes the screwdriver to feel this way quite often. Doesn't seem broken though."

Excellent screwdriver. Works as good as advertised. Would definitely recommend
Excellent
Brought for two mechanics and they both love them
"This is definitely the most expensive but best screwdriver I've ever had. The moment I first held it, I immediately thought, 'Wow, this is good quality.' The bits are also of high quality, and everything operates very smoothly. I'm not worried about the bits falling out or being too difficult to remove. I'm also satisfied with the bit holder, as it gives you access to many bits at once. All in all, it's a pricey purchase but definitely a good screwdriver."

"I recently had to build a new computer, and this screwdriver really shined. It is solid has all the bits and the quality is great. It's solid, made the building of a computer really easy. Yes the bits do lose coating, but that's expected from usage anyways."
"Literally when I received it, I wanted to disassemble all my house's furniture, to just have a chance to use it. \nIt is very pleasant in the hand. It has all the bits I need. The magnets are plenty strong. Overall very happy. \nThe only thing to consider is that it's quite big, even the bits, so for example working with small electronics you might not be able to use it. I had a situation with an air compressor where the screw hole was too narrow to reach into. But then again it seems like the purpose of this driver is a bit different."
"Screwdriver itself feels really solid and the ratcheting mechanic is great, great product would recommend!"
"Every time I use the screwdriver, I'm reminded of the Rick and Morty episode where Morty experiences \""True Level.\""   Using it is an experience that makes you not want to go back to using the old caveman tools.  While my other screwdrivers at home were perfectly usable, I bought it to support LTT without knowing how much of a difference its features would actually make.  I wasn't looking for knurling, or in handle storage, but have found the well thought out features make small tasks easier (and more likely to get done).  It feels very well built, and smooth, to the point where I keep it on my desk as a fidget even when I don't plan to use it for its intended purpose."
"A beautiful feeling and sounding screwdriver. However, I wish that they stated that it comes with the standard bit set. This may sound stupid, but I was under the impression that the standard bit set was something different, so I bought it with my screwdriver and just ended up with more of the same bits, oops!"

I work with electronic components and screws every day and this is a game changer for how handy and comfortable to use it is.\nHighly raccomend!
This is a great and very versatile screwdriver.  Linus and crew continuously deliver great products and content.  Love the channel and Linus.
I love how comfortable it fits in my hand and how easy it is to use! The grippy shaft is fantastic to get screws started and I find it very intuitive to switch the driver direction. I would definitely say its the best screwdriver I've ever used.
Amazing product and a great gift for the pops!

i decided to bite the bullet and get one to replace my 1 year old wera ratchet screwdriver as it had started to get alot of slop in the ratchet and shaft (it had some out of the box but now it ruined). i have been blown away by the LTT driver it is hands down better quality than the wera driver . 100% will be getting another (realy want the clear one what was teased in a video to mach my JerryRigEverything knife) maybe in a year and let you all know how it has held up
What a delightful screwdriver. It's not hyped it's just that good.
"This screwdriver is very high quality, and the ratchet is the best I have ever felt."
"I do industrial diesel generator manufacturing so I was pretty concerned if it could hold up to the abuse. It does, very well infact. Along with the workshop jacket, the screwdriver is a great addition for mechanics and manufacturing, not just hobbies and pc building. The back force is good, best out of my mechanical ratcheting screwdrivers but not quite as good as my one way bearing style screwdrivers as I expected. Still a very tough driver and one of the best I've seen for the money."
"Handle is too small for XL hands.  No PZ2 bit (everything uses PZ2s).\nDelivery was slow.  Customer service was slow to reply. \nScrewdriver mechanism is fine, it was the biggest selling point of the driver. \nMagmatism is strong, holds screw well."

"It's the best Ratcheting Screwdriver by far compared to any of the others, but it's a little pricey especially in Canada after shipping came to $140CAD. This is my second one because I loved my first one so much before I lost it, definitely recommend."
great screwdriver. LTTSTORE.COM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's just as good as they claim it to be. Very happy with my purchase.
I just started a job as a lube technician. This screwdriver is amazing for my job. Makes taking air filter boxes apart a breeze. Used it to work on my pc a few times too and couldn't recommend it more.
"You've seen all the good reviews already, I'm not here to repeat how great this screwdriver is for not only tech stuff but also daily work.\nInstead, I want to focus on the support.\nAfter ~1 month of owning the screwdriver, it broke, kind of. The shaft became loose and the \""locked\"" position would start skipping instead of staying fixated. I made a 4-minute demonstration video, sent a simple message with the video link to the support, and in 30 MINUTES(!!!!!!!!) I got a response from Nolan (shout-out btw, you're the GOAT) with a  shipment label for a brand-new one. \nI'm sure I was just lucky, but still, the response time was incredible. "

"Very good quality, nice feeling when operating it and good looking as well. The price i a bit steep but I expect it to last long enough"
The only complaint is the paint coating comes off of the bit attachments so quickly.
"Used it for a few build, some house work and for furniture. Very nice driver."
I bought one because I was tired of having to swap between 3-5 different screwdrivers while doing DIY around the house.\nIt's now the first tool o pick up and the only screwdriver I use.
"I’ve had the screwdriver for about a month and I use it daily during the work week. I love the in-hand feel and the rigidity of the ratchet.\nThat said, in my first week of use I lost a bit due to one of the plastic bit holders snapping. I use it often but I’m far from hard on the screwdriver so that was a bit disappointing because I can only carry 11 bits now. Nonetheless, it remains my go-to driver and overall I’m content with the purchase."

"As I have built my last 6 Gaming rigs, it would have been really nice to have had this Screwdriver in the Past.\nBut I have it now. Awesome"
"I like very much the screw driver, especially the strong magnet. I want to point out some drawbacks I noticed. First is that bit holders are easily to break especially when drop the screw driver. I would have liked if somehow bit holder be magnetic. Next i noticed there is no pozidriv bit. For europe would be more useful if offer that bit option at least in separate purchase set."
"Smooth ratcheting motion hasn't run any screws back, good handfeel, well built, great reach. \nDo have some questions about durability of bitholder (particularly the tabs of plastic that holds your bits) but so far so good.\nObviously miles better then your 10 dollar home improvement store special.\nHowever, I did subtract a star for it's boutique price.\nMegapro's variant costs 50 or so US and that feels about right for a tool of this quality level."
"Very good so far, the bit holder looks a bit fragile, the driver is a tad to large to my taste (example I was not able to mount a pc screen mount cause it would not fit in the holes, sad for a computer oriented company :) )"
Great  product I can't think of anything bad to say. Maybe the price but at least I'm supporting lmg.

"Expensive as it might be, this thing does truly live up to the hype. Every part is exquisitely crafted, it is beautiful in not only its design and function but also the look, feel, and sound of it."
The screwdriver is amazing because of the bit storage and the ratchet is super smooth and really gives you a better feel on those tiny screws. Only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because I can’t use my I fixit bits. When I need unique bit size. I can’t just use bits from my I fixit kit.
"Very expensive for a screwdriver, but it works great. I use it for the finishing work in residential HVAC. "
"My expectation was on the low end, but oh boy, how was I wrong. It's so fun to use compared to generic tools. Perfect for my EDC."
"Since I got it I keep picking it up when I'm on a call, the ratchet feels so nice and used it to install my solar panel for my mini setup"

"Nothing to say, just good as it looks and the money is all worthy and not overrated as some might think"
"When twisting using my fingers, the gears keep sticking, not allowing the screwdriver to ratchet. Seems I got a dud."
"If you find yourself in the unenviable position of having to put together £2000 of IKEA furniture in a single weekend, you need to make sure you have an LTT screwdriver with you. The ratchet back pressure is ideal for dealing with all the fiddle little, infuriatingly shaped screws you will find yourself fighting against when going one-on-one with a BESTA TV unit. The handy direction collar is extremely useful when you inevitably make a mistake have to take the unit apart to fix an error on step one."
"So, I followed the whole process before getting this screwdriver and I also own a megapro, so I know where it come from, I must say that it’s just perfect, I already built two systems with it, and it has anything you need. Compared to the megapro it’s smaller but it’s for the best, working on electronics is best to have mobility and versatility, the ltt screwdriver has both. Wonderful job ltt!"
"I've used this thing for cars, assembling Ikea furniture and even ripping sheeting iron off a roof, not only does it take it with stride but makes my impact gun look slow and appalling, I only bought this screwdriver as a investment towards building computers and maybe abit of Automotive work but it's been my main screwdriver for everything and hasn't let me down other than it being abit big for some headlight assembly's to adjust them"

"In my opinion as a design engineer, this product is proof that development time produces high quality products.\nTools are designed to do jobs, this hits the nail on the head *NOT LITERALLY THIS IS NOT A HAMMER."
great screwdriver. Knurling really helps and magnetic strength is excellent
"I gave it to my Son as a birthday present. He is a E-sports event organizer, and cannot stop raving how good it is."

"Got this to build my new PC, and I absolutely love it. Price is up there, but it's a screwdriver for life so definitely worth it."
"I use it almost every day for tinkering, and it has not let me down once! it is very comfortable to use, and the ratchet is a great fidget toy."
"Works great and is easy on the wrist. It fits extremely well in my hand, almost unnaturally so... Took a while to save up for this but it was definitely worth it."
"This is the best screwdriver I have ever used. \nI work in the Audio Visual field and find that I use this every day with the standard bit set.\n it’s super comfortable in the hand. \nOne huge feature is the magnetic bit strength, I have not had the bit get pulled out of the driver.\nHighly recommend."
"Great screwdriver, ratchet mechanism is S tier, love it so much I'm going to buy the stubby for those tighter space use cases."

"I love this screw driver, and even use this screwdriver as a fidget item and ratchet it absent-mindedly. I definitely recommend if you can afford it."
Comes a good selection and works very well. I love the magnet.
"This is a good driver, good weight, and good hand fit.  Only real complaint is the knurling is a bit sharp.  I ended up shredding my finger on it while driving some screws.  The knurling also scratches plastic/metal if you aren’t careful driving screws in narrow spaces."
"Feels great, perfect for everyday use"
I use it daily and it’s reliable. Survived several drops. I would recommend it

"I love this screw driver, works fantastic. I haven't had too many opportunities to use it this past month, but at this point I'm going out out of my way to use it because I love it. Also, I just love spinning it because the hand feel and sound are fantastic, to the point that my gaming buddies get upset because they can hear it over my mic."
I love it. It's handy to have all the bits at hand in such a small package.\nIt is perfect for assembling or disassembling PCs and electric devices.
"I expected the screwdriver to be very good, and I am not disappointed. The knurling is awesome. I bought a similar driver from Wera which is not even close. The ratchet sometimes locks up a bit. I have to change the selector and everything is fine again. A minor annoyance but I wanted to mention it."
"Use it regularly for plate and modem installing for telecommunications company. Extremely happy with the ratchet design because you never get confused which way you want to turn. Left for remove, right to tighten. Most other drivers I have used go the opposite way, which gets annoying when you are trying tighten a stubborn screw and find it in reverse."
"Was really worried about real quality but when I got this screwdriver my worries were gone. Yes, it's expensive but this is maybe first screwdriver which makes me not to worry about accidentally dropping the screw inside a PC. The magnet is great! Already tested with basic car maintenance and PC part swaps and I really like it."

"Wanted to see what it was all about, and my god I wasn't disappointed. The ratchet does sound really nice and the selector was definitely made by keyboard enthusiasts. The low friction needed to activate the ratchet surprised me and came in handy pulling apart computers. only thing that could've changed is the bit holder, it feels like it's going to break every time I put s bit back, however hasn't been the case yet"
"Driver is very good, extra bit storage (off driver) is really needed."
Good screwdriver. They weren’t kidding about the ratchet and its really easy to use with one hand.
As someone with mobility and fine motor skill issues I appreciate a bunch of things about the screwdriver. The ergonomic handle fits well in your hand and is comfortable. The ratchet mechanism and switch make it very easy to use. I also like the extra magnetic head.  It help pick up screws and hold them in place better than the average screwdriver which makes things a lot easier with my decreased motor skills.  
"I have been using the LTT screwdriver at work for a week (repairing medical devices), it has been a pleasure, all the tips that I need at my disposal and the magnet tip has saved me hours of desmanteling a device to retrieve a screw. The only down side it has is that for me to have more tips I will have to wait until you guys drop again the shipping cost, you realy need an european warehouse (please) :D"

I think the ratchet feels really good. I've had a Bahco screwdriver before but it doesn't have as fine ratchet.\nDoes anyone use the square bits?
"Good screwdriver. They weren’t kidding about the ratchet design, so smooth!"
"I ve just used it to do maintenance on my computer and it is a good product, I like the fidgeting with the shaft and the bits that’s come along were just what I needed to do what I wanted :)"
"It is the best ratcheting screwdriver I have. However the grip is little bit too smooth. Also the default bitset should have pozidrive bits, maybe instead the square bits. Also metric hex bitset was not available when I bought it during the free shipping promo."
"Got this during the lime day free shipping promo. Shipping to Europe took a while, but unlike last time i ordered VAT was included so i had no hassle with customs, which is great.  (hooray IOSS)"

"I've used it a lot for my equipment, much more user friendly than my last screwdriver (comparing $5 to $60...) and it feels like a sturdy tool"
"Great project, they had to send me 2 new ones because I kept getting a defective product. To their credit it was quick responses and they got all the issues handled very well."
"I already had a Bacho ratcheting screwdriver, but I was not very happy with it so I sprung for the LTT model and so far no regrets. My main gripes with the Bacho were that the ratchet mechanism had a tendency to jam up, the selector ring direction was un-intuitive and that the bit storage was not very handy. The LTT model fixed all those issues for me and I gotta say, the low drag ratchet makes starting screws a lot easier, especially if there's no pre-drilled hole and you have to use your other hand for holding things together. That alone makes it a worth while purchase for me. I'm giving 4 stars because the Bacho is still a better value in my opinion at around 20-25€ versus the 70€ (+ tax!) LTT driver."
"I’ve had nothing but the best experience with this product. The ratchet is smooth, the magnet is solid, and the handle fits great in my hand."
"The build quality is questionable.\nThe ratchet does not work smoothly, but stutters.\nThe seams on the handle are not smooth.\nThe quality/price ratio does not match."

"No issues whatsoever.\nTook a while to arrive, but to be fair I am at the other end of the globe."
Only complaint is when dropped bits can fly out other than that it’s been amazing!
"I'm happy with the screwdriver, it's as advertised.  As a bonus for me, it's never left my desk because I also use it as a fidget spinner."
I keep this in our family's junk drawer & pull it out often around the house. Ratcheting mechanic is sturdy & easy to use. I love the bits in the handle & my only complaint is that the standard set features a few bits that I don't anticipate using.
All my other screwdrivers are dead to me.

10/10 screwdriver; can't complain about build quality and overall function. Gets the job done well and is a great tool for when I'm fixing 3D printers and coaching robotics.
Only flaw I can find is the strong magnet at the tip which causes the tip to be pulled by the frame you want to un/screw from leading to inaccuracies socketing the screw.
"works as described, good screwdriver."
Literally the worst screw driver I have ever purchased. Would recommend to others but wish there was an all black option and shipping didn't cost an arm and a leg.
"Very happy with this superb fidget toy, the top lid opens and closes in a VERY satisfying way, you can spend a long time going open-close-open-close-open-close.... without getting unsatisfied - only downside is one, or I at least, needs both hands, I havent figured out how to open it with only holding it in one hand and like keep working with the other, at least not in an as satisfying way; then again, who needs work when they can fidget. On the other side you have safe dial simulator that's even more satisfying then the lid, just turning it feels oh sooo good and works perfectly one-handed, so you can fidget while doing other stuff with the other hand! There's also a dial that (that in itself is another fidgeting feature) that lets you choose the turning direction; with some clever timing you can feel like one of those movie safe crackers that \""decode\"" the code dial of the safe by turning it 80 right, 32 left, 42 right - the sound it makes is ASMR for people liking that kind of sound."

"The screwdriver I got for my birthday was awesome, but the lefty loosey direction started slipping after a couple months. When I contacted support asking what could be done and if they wanted me to ship it back, they immediately sent me a replacement no runaround, no complications 100% stellar and this one has been working great!"

"Perfect for PC building, very nice to have in every house."
Quality screwdriver for all your screwing needs
"if u look for useful review ,this one is not for you. I bought this on lime day as excuse to support LMG.  I still normally use IFixit for for most stuff (which is for raspberry pi and pc)but I found this screwdriver useful to retrive screws and when i need use for something that is out of reach for ifixit. i didn't do linus test (drop it). for my case support lmg, it works great, for using as screwdriver ... it works"
Ordered it almost two months ago and they never shipped it. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited before contacting support and now have to hope I actually receive the replacement.
"Great screwdriver. Had to buy twice because airline made me throw it away (had never flown with tools before, didn't know they had to be under 7 inches)."

"Really good screwdriver, but for the price I expected more. There is a fair amount of give when you have to use it as a regular screwdriver. The handle isn't as comfortable as I expected for extended use. Have not used for any PC building (which I expect is where this would shine). The most disappointing aspect is the finish on the bits. They came with a black coating, which I did expect to show wear, but it started showing wear just by first few uses. Overall it's very nice, especially the magnetic bits, but not sure if I would buy again without it being an everyday tool."
"Daily use. Used in server rooms, under bridges, in break rooms, among others. Best screwdriver I own."
"This screwdriver is amazing. I moved recently, and purchased it in anticipation of having to disassemble and reassemble furniture. It has been a wrist saver! I didn't realize it came with the standard bit set, so I bought an additional one by mistake. Clearly my own fault for not reading all the details on the product."
Great screwdriver. The knurling is amazing and it’s very sleek
It feels high quality and I really like the design of the compartment at the bottom.

"As the title states, this is by far the best ratcheting screwdriver I have ever used."
"Unfortunately, the screwdriver got minimally scuffed in shipping."
"The quick thought, whenever looking at a product, is the cost compared to similar products. One comparison would be against a set of normal screwdrivers with the different screwheads. That is not a fair comparison due to this being a rachet screwdriver and the reduced effort needed to screw in more difficult screws. The other comparison is with a drill and screwdriver combo - something that I have moved away from due to stripped screwheads. So this sits in the middle."
"Love my screwdriver, very nice feel like the tips that came with, will order more, great service. A+++++"

"Honestly probably not the demographic for this as I don't use it often enough to truly apprexiate it, but I can say that the quality of the materials is superb, and even after dropping it many times it feels as sturdy as the day it arrived, and the ratchet spins freely, smoothly, and is extremely satisfying, so if nothing else you get an awesome fidgrt toy, which is what I mainly use it for :)"
Good replacement and good communication
Best screw driver on the market. Simple as.
Love this thing!!!
"bought his thing a while ago and I've been using it regularly. it's one of if not the best screwdriver I've ever used, I've built furniture, mowing equipment, and face shields with it. it's not cheap, but the price is definitely justified. do buy if you can afford it and if you're looking for a screwdriver! it even fits and magnetizes regularly sized bits!"

"Good product , very well made I think its a bit on the pricy side for the overall item. Even so it is a good product used it for a while and it is nice and easy to use. It doesn't look expensive but to use its well made but again quite a lot of money"
"My previous daily (screw-)driver was a Wera so my expectations to this tool we're quite high. But I have not for a single use regretted to have replaced the Wera with this screwdriver. The clicking is awesome, nearly no backlash, not a single issue with it!\nHighly recommended!"
"Now that I have one, I find that I want to get more. I have started putting together move kits for my teenagers move out on their own. This screwdriver does everything but the most tiny screws (keep away from the Nintendo Switch and it's joy cons).  It has excellent weight to it, which is the only down side for me. I was crippled in an accident years ago and my hands work more like a 90+ year old great grandma. My husband and kids are all more than happy to help use this screwdriver, I just have to be very diligent about not allowing them to walk away with it. I would recommend for anyone."
"This screwdriver is almost perfect. Nice haptics and looks. Only flaw is in some use cases the screwdriver is too long or too thick to reach the screw. But for it's main intended purpose of building PCs there is no issue so far. Also I would love to have some more bits in standard package I often use, without the need to buy another full set of for example the hex bits when I would only use 2 of them."
"Bought this for my Dad's 50th, as a gift for someone that's worked in tech for 29 years he's been extremely impressed with it's feel and how easy and quick it is to use & he hasn't stopped raving on about how he loves it for work. massive thanks for all the hard work you guys have put into this product and all your other products."

"Fantastic product with incredible attention to detail. You pay for what you get. This is an expensive screwdriver, but you're buying high quality. Love the ratchet system that ratchets even with the loosest screws. Love the gnarled shaft, love the bit holder, love the short bits. It has very little play in the locked  position, and easy to switch to the tighten and loosen positions. Big thumbs up if you can afford it."
"I work in phone/electronics repair and I find it easier to use on most devices outside of iPhones, especially the PS%. I don't really have any negatives to say about it, and one the holster is out I will probably get that as well, to hold it while moving around the shop. Everyone else im my shop uses it as well although one of the guys prefers the iFixit kit for phones."
"First note: I am a craftsman, not a fanboy.  This review is purely about the technical quality of the screwdriver, not the branding, color, etc.\nNote 2: I own many multi-bit screwdrivers from craftsman, triplet, autoloader, ifixit and others.  \nThe triplet / autoloaders are not ratcheting but offer faster bit change. \nThe Craftsman both autoloads and ratchets but is quite bulky. \nOne nameless model holds 18 bits but neither ratchets nor auto loads.\nMany come with large sets of bits in a separate box or strip."
While I definitely know not to do a major drop test its well built and insanely comfortable in my hand. Half of the bits that came with the driver were rattling around the box sadly. Thankfully the magnetic bit held the rest in its package. All of the other bit sets I got were wrapped together with multiple rubberbands so they were going nowhere. Overall very happy and looking forward to using it extensively.
"I ordered two of these, one for me and one as a Christmas gift (I like to shop early in case it goes back order!). So I like the product.\nOne thing I noticed as a clear difference was the magnetic pull of the screwdriver was reduced. Also, the shaft now has a little wobble, but even the new one has it too. It might be a feature though. But it doesn't affect the ratcheting action, so it's okay."

"This driver has been one of my better purchases this year. It does the job just right, and doesn't cause frustration at all when using!"
"Im really a fan of this screwdriver, I use it for everything in the House and it did not disappoint so far. The standard bit set is perfect for the average consumer especially the magnet bit. And I have absolutely no complains so far. 👍"
"The perfect junk drawer screwdriver.  Feels great, has bits for most common screws right out of the box.  Powerful magnets to hold on to screws while you're driving them."
The quality is amazing and the magnetic tip makes it easy to keep ahold on smaller screws without losing them

Beautifully engineered and all round solid.
"The feeling is great, quality also. Have been using it for a while now on certain works (especially electrical related). \nThings that I do miss though: \n-PZ bits (not even available in the bitsets). \n- Electrical safe handle and shaft (not even sure if this would be possible, but a man can only dream)."
It great addition to my toolbox
"This is the best screw driver I have ever used. My only complaint is that the shaft wobbles a tiny bit but I understand how that is a miniscule detail. I love how it feels in the hand and the ratchet mechanism is very nearly flawless. I also enjoy the variety of bits that are available and I'm very impressed at how many bits can be stored in the handle. It is a very compact package that can be used for pretty much anything and it's not uncomfortable. I'd say I have \""torture tested\"" this screwdriver through the daily abuse I put it through and it has held up phenomenally. I am extremely impressed and very happy I purchased this screwdriver."

Excellent quality product!
"Solid product, very nice to work with. I accumulated lots of different screwdrivers over the years, but exclusively they're either completely manual or battery powered - I never knew I need a ratchet screwdriver until I ordered this product! It fits perfectly in between using a manual screw driver and a battery powered one and I'd say up to 80% of my screw driving needs can be met with this ratchet screwdriver! The tool itself is robust, well balanced and the mechanism is really satisfying to work with - hope it'll last very long!"
"This is a tool I would use not all the time, but when I need a screwdriver, it thier when I need it."
"The ratchet is satisfying and works flawlessly. The knurling on the shaft helps for fiddly bits, or getting a screw started. The bit holder is vital. Absolutely love the thing."
Works well and comfortable to use. Can be used in most situations.

Solid piece of kit.
Works great ! little to no backdrag which is nice . Very comfortable easy to get good pressure . Magnet is a huge upgrade and nice not to worry about pulling a bit out .
Great piece of equipment. Delivery time to Australia was very bad >30days. It was worth the wait when it did finally arrive.
This thing is so smooth and easy to use. I've been building PCs since I was 11 back in '94 and this is the best screwdriver that I've ever used. I'm especially impressed with the magnetic tip because I've always wanted a screwdriver that would actually hold my screws while I lowered them down into where they needed to go. Very happy with this.
Good quality screwdriver. The magnetism is really good.

"Ordered this to the UK with great anticipation. It arrived pretty quickly, well within the 14 days. I've not put this screwdriver down since getting it. The ratchet feels great. Magnetic strong as advertised. Well worth it imo."
"I bought this because it looked like a nicely made, long lasting tool which I like the idea of, and because I wanted to support a YouTube channel who's content I appreciate. "
Amazing quality and works very well. The magnet are really strong as well.
The LTT Screwdriver is my first screwdriver- practically flawless by function- only pet peeve was that the bits provided aren’t as durable when used extensively… easily overlooked though.
"Great screwdriver and very good quality, magnet is super great!"

"Great quality, good to keep in a bag to have handy with most of the bits I need."
"My most significant criticism is that the \""Diamond-cut Knurling\"" cannot be rotated with 1 finger, it requires a grip from opposing fingers, in order to turn. If you push it with 1 finger, there is microscopic slack, that locks it in place and prevents rotation. I have to put my finger really close to the body of the screwdriver over the smooth part in order to do it with 1 finger, but without pressing too hard, otherwise, it will lock it."
Yup
"Works well very handy, Some rare cases the tip is too short for the application, and the shaft seems like its broken when it turns clockwise but i love the magnet and ratchet mechanism"
"Satisfying to use, functional, balanced, well designed and built - what’s not to love? Slay girlies xox"

"All this talk of a ratcheting screwdriver. 🪛 What was all the hype about? Well a solidly built screwdriver, really well balanced, looks great and the design is super clean. The ratchet is buttery smooth, feels great in the hand and makes life so much easier. Love the bit holder in the handle, no more searching through a box of bits it’s all there. And to top it off the knurling is great, love the feel when using it."
Wish I would have bought sooner. I now look for things around the house that needs tightening.
"I bought the LTT screwdriver on the first announcement. I later bought two more. They are comfortable, have all the bits needed for PC repairs (that I've done so far), and it's a solid design! Well done!"
I love the screwdriver but I regret supporting LTT after these recent allegations.  Truly sad how this company has sunk.
"Tenhle šroubovák jsem kupoval s jistou mírou skepse, protože systémy s řehtačkou mě nikdy nepřišly použitelné pro svoji tuhost. Tenhle je ale super, s minimálním odporem a nepříliš těžkou rukojetí (a to i když je plná bitů)! Také tvar padne do ruky, pokud je aspoň střední velikosti a neklouže i bez pogumovaného povrchu. Pokud bude životnost taková, jako snadnost a lehkost používání, koupil jsem si nejlepší šroubovák svého života :-)"

"All the time spent developing the screwdriver was worth it! From the smoothness of the ratchet to the strength of the magnet. It lives in my kitchen draw now and is my go to versatile driver for any quick repairs at home. I’m an Australian based buyer. Shipping was adequate for international, provided link was useless however, updates stopped when it got to LA. Local courier dropped the ball and delivered it to the wrong address but I received it same day thanks to the person who received it doing the right thing and contacting the courier to alert them of the situation. Had they not have however, I wouldn’t have been as lucky."

"Got one for both my dad and myself and we both think it's great.\nThe ratcheting mechanisme works great, and the bit storage in the handle is ideal, always have my most used bits and not putting them somewhere to forget them."
"This screw driver got the dawg in him,  the absolute best.  It feels comfortable, easy to use, very nice and satisfying torque, and excellent quality over all."
Great screwdriver! The feel is worthy of the price and the times i used it i had no issues with it
"A great screwdriver! And I really like the sound it makes!\nDelivery took a while, but the tracking worked great"
"If you are looking for a ratcheting screwdriver, nothing beats this one. The amount of bits you get on purchase is fantastic. The best screwdriver I have ever owned and I tried some interesting ones in the past."

The screwdriver is indeed a crazy good product. It is really well build and feels super chunky in your hand. The bit storage in the back is extremely handy. I really like this thing!
"Very robust, just built a pc and Ikea furniture and it was fantastic for both. The feel and bit storage is amazing"
Bought it to give to a friend and of course I had to try it out first. Safe to say my own will be ordered soon.
This is an absolutely amazing driver and was worth my wait to get one. I have been using it as much as I possibly can and once I ran out of projects at home I started going over my parents house and started fixing stuff at their place just so I can use my driver more. I even keep my LTT screwdriver with my ifixit kit so I can tackle anything. Great combo! Everyone should have an LTT screwdriver in their bag!
all is good.pretty happy wifh the purchase.i am waiting for the stubby ratcheting.and also kindly release a screwdriver holster and also a torch light.

"So previous to this one I had a little Strebito kit, an amazon dirt cheap little driver with tons of precision bits. To be honest the feel, the balance, the LTT logo, the storage on itself, the ability to unscrew, lock or screw and the lenght of the shaft with the little dots grip made it the BEST possible screwdriver to have ever owned. I will get another one when they release other models or the same but in a variety of colors to the get my favorite black/green combo. This has become my favorite for everything it only needs an adapter use other size of bits insertion and then I could use my cheap strebito 0, 00, 000 phillips bits."
"The screwdriver is as advertised, very good quality. The mechanism is smooth, the handle shape and knurling are very comfortable. Time will tell if it is durable, but I'm very happy with it.\nThe international shipping was slow, but I'm not deducting points because this seems to be a problem for every company. At least they do ship to my country!"
I thought of getting this screwdriver for months. it was definitely worth buying
Definitely worth the hype. Amazing screwdriver

Great screwdriver perfect for your all your computer and handy man needs
Works great. Looking forward to the little one.
"Ohhhhooooooooo man! This screw driver is one of the best tools I have used for PC and general electronic building and maintenance. It features a set of magnetic drill bits and shaft, a sturdy and rigid construction, and a well made handle to store your drill bits, and a ratcheting mechanism to help make adding or removing screws a breeze. The magnetic drill bits are especially useful for helping hang on to those little screws that can easily get lost., the handle has a nice grip feel to it, and the ratcheting component is amazing. I have already bought to, one for me and one for a friend. I look forward to the Noctua edition screw driver. I would very much recommend this tool to anyone who needs a good, solid, toolset for maintaining their PC."
"The screwdriver screws very well, I would love to screw with Linus one day"
"Despite having some shipping problems and getting it a bit late, doens't change the quality of the product. It is simply incredible."

"This purchase makes sense for the international customer, if you look at it as a long-term investment. It doesn't make sense if in 20 years time, LTT decides to make the bit heads unavailable. Nice Product."
No complaints
"I was genuinely surprised when I first picked it up. It feels great in my hand (although I wish it had some sort of soft touch/grip points on the handle) and the magnet is strong, I often use it to pick up screws juuuust out of reach. I hope there’s a stubby version in the cards. Great job guys on a great tool."
"I first tried the screwdriver at a friends house who went to the launch event to buy one. I was so enamored by it, that I knew it was something I needed to get for myself. Fast forward a month and I bought one. It arrived relatively quickly and my unit was as good as the one I tried. Everything about the product is satisfying, from the shape of the handle to the practicality and fidget potential of the bit storage and ratchet mechanism. The screwdriver has stayed at my desk because of this. Not a day goes by where I am home and don’t fiddle with it. Additionally, the bit pack it comes with meets 85% of my needs and this number is brought to 99% after adding the torx bit pack. On top of it all, the written warranty complemented by the people behind it inspire confidence in me that I will be taken care of should a problem ever arise with my unit. 10/10 would recommended"
"It’s one of the best tools I ever had, I am not saying that is special or unique, I am sure that digging here and there I were able to find something similar but without exaggerating I can say that he saved me in craft different situations , from the DIY at home to the most specific work related issues in the middle of nothing in the Aussie desert …. Is working well and is doing what was in the description . What we can ask more ?? Last but not least I prefer to spend the money on LTT store than in a general tool brand out there . A pleasant surprise ."

Very nice. Has been my go to since getting.
"after a week, I finally had a chance to really use this thing properly. it worked incredibly! managed to effortlessly screw screws with one hand and even almost stripped some crappier screws without so much as scratching the bit. if you want a damn good screwdriver, this is the one."
To get two expensive screwdriver and have both boxes coming damaged because there was no protection around each box was very disappointing.
"A screwdriver, does what it says on the tin, and so much more. The bits in the handle, the knurling for spinning the shaft by itself, the magnetic bit socket, everything feels perfectly honed for a great experience. 10/10 tbh"
"I love the feel and finsh, the ratchet is as described by Linus and the fact I can store bits in it makes it so much better"

I use this screwdriver on everything I can. It is so handy with all the bits in the handle.
"I've been using the screwdriver fairly regularly for a few weeks now and it is absolutely wonderful from an ergonomic perspective. The built-in bit storage means I'm not leaving a pointy bit in the driver most of the time, which reduces it catching on things as I slide it in and out of my pocket. This is also the first screwdriver I've ever used where I basically never have to use the \""neutral\"" ratchet setting. It's so consistent that I can 0-100 bolts without any time wasted backing them back out on accident. A++++++"
"I already expected a quality product from LTT. Their attitude towards producing anything, while it's a product or a video, seems to be if they do it, they'll be sure to do it right. And that definitely goes for the LTT screwdriver. And not just quality of built, but also details like the bitset in the handle. Solid and good. The first week I actually went out my way to find something to fix, just to use the LTT screwdriver. I live in the Netherlands, still worth the shipping, and arrived pretty fast as well. Love it!"
Works well
"I brought this to build my pc with and when I tell you this is the best driver ever I mean it! It so convenient to have all the screw bits at the bottom of the handle, for that quick bit access!! Thanks for making such a driver"

Works well and feels good in the hands. Luke even answered my friend's question.
"Firstly, this screwdriver is awesome, it’s pretty well built, the ratchet is super nice, and the bit holder is super cool. I love almost everything about this screwdriver and it looks awesome, the customer support is great too, I had one issue and they were fast and super nice. I love LTT stuff and this is yet another great product and I can’t wait to see more."
Really like the tool. Haven't had to use it a huge amount yet but it's easily the best ratcheting screwdriver I've needed for school and work. Looking forward to future versions as I'm extremely pleased with the quality feeling and weight of this one. 
Very well built driver. It feels good in the hand and doesn't feel like it will fall apart easy. The bits are secure yet east to remove by hand.  I have been using this a lot and have had no issues with it at all.
Best screwdriver i ever used. Made building a pc more quicker

"This thing is head and shoulders above any ratcheting screwdriver I've owned before. It's expensive, but it certainly feels worth it when using it. Bit storage is handy and well thought out. I haven't had it long, but it sure is a nice tool to have. Magnetic buts have nice, strong magnets which are super nice for getting a screw started or out of its housing. Ratcheting mechanism is excellent."
So slick.
Great Scrwedriver
"I've had my skroof for almost two months, and I absolutely love it. It's been useful countless times, from taking apart gutters to unclog them, to finding/reaching things with the included magnet bit, to having an amazing fidget toy when I'm bored, and so much more. It's been amazing to not have to look through my dad's and grandpa's numerous unorganized messes of tools just to find a skroof, since I can now just reach in to my pocket to grab a skroof that's better than any other that we've ever had."

Hands down the most usefully designed screwdriver ever.  It is truly a pleasure to use and has become my go to at work and home.  Can't wait to get the stubby one when it's available.  No complaints here.
Fantastic screwdriver as advertised
"I'm a (mostly) residential service electrician, and had been using a Klein ratcheting screwdriver until I broke it. I loved that screwdriver, until I picked up an LTT screwdriver. This thing is simply superior. The ratcheting mechanism is much more precise, the teeth seem much more fine with less effort required for each click, but it still feels every bit as durable if not more than the Klein. The magnetic tip doesn't hurt either. The only negative I've found is that the bit holding part is too big to fit into some tandem breakers, but I may fix that with a grinder someday. Overall 10/10, fantastic screwdriver."
I just love the ratchet of this thing. So satisfying and makes it so nice to use! Only downside is that I've started to disassemble and then re-assemble my kitchen.. I can't stop. Please send help!
I got 2 for fathers day. One for myself and one for my father. I love mine and he loves his. We use them for everything now it stays with me or my car at all times thank you for making it easy to keep with us!

"I was lucky enough to be able to buy myself one of these astoundingly well made ratcheting screwdrivers as a belated birthday present to myself. At just under £70 it was well into the luxury end of the range of tools I now own. That said, it is a real workhorse! It needs less force than any other hand-tool I have, the ratchet is silky smooth with a selector that is firm but gentle. The standard bits that are included are ideal for most IT tasks you could think of, with specialty bits easily available through LTTStore.com at a very reasonable price. The integrated bit holder works well, and securely holds all the different, high-quality bits without risking losing any.\nI have been using the screwdriver for a few weeks now, and have not even considered using anything else, so much so that I have even given some of my older drivers to one of my local charity stores. The driver itself has an astonishingly strong magnet that prevents you losing anything you're screwing into place. Are there any drawbacks? No, not that I've found so far. No, the driver isn't the cheapest on the market, but neither is it the most expensive. Is it reliable? Definitely! Is it good value for money? Certainly! Personally, I think it's the best screwdriver available, regardless of price. The bits are extremely strong, and, unless you 'really' abuse them, will probably last you a lifetime.\nAnother point I like about my screwdriver, is that it comes with a limited lifetime guarantee. If the worst should happen, you can return your purchase to receive a replacement, giving you full peace of mind. It's a proper \""Trust Me Bro',\"" guarantee."
Top Ratchening Screwdriver for PC Builders for hard outside work it isnt perfect. The Grip isnt so grippy as other ones. Thanks to the team to create this screwdriver!
"This tool requires less strength and hand movement to loosen or tight screws. It also has a nice grip and magnetic tip, so the screws would not fall if you were in an awkward position."
"Just by using it, it felt so good using it, and I was kinda afraid that I would break it... but I didn't, it was tougher than it looks, and it performed as expected."
Was pleasently surprised by the good quality of the ratcheting function and overall quality.

"Used it to change my fans on my pc. Used more frequently on general household screwdriving needs. With this, I feel like I use less force to drive a screw. The magnets are really strong and handy. I know this is a screwdriver I can count on for more years to come."
But no JIS bits?
"Absolutely amazing. As somebody who has never owned or been that big of a handy man , the screwdriver honestly inspired me to work more with my hands. Whether that's building furniture or building my PC, I've absolutely enjoyed using it."
After about a months worth of use my dad has said it’s the last screwdriver he will ever need. Good job on taking a tool and making it more useful and good in all jobs!
It’s a really nice screwdriver with a magnet that has come in handy more times than I can count. I will definitely be getting plenty of use out of this bad boy.

"works very well as a screwdriver, my only gripe is that the body is slightly slippery after some time of hard and sweaty work."
Nice and smooth action. Loads of room for extra ammo in handle. I sleep with it under my pillow.
Works very good as a screwdriver but even better as a toy for the desk. Most satisfying ratchet and bitmag to keep me entertained while boring team meetings
"As a maker, home handy man, automotive enthusiast and in my professional carrier I find myself using all sorts of tools all the time. I really liked the design choices of this driver. The ratchet, ratchet selector feel and selector direction is so nice. I really liked the knurled shaft, strong magnet, part quality, fitment and overall feel of everything. The standard load out of bits was also well thought out."
The best screw driver I’ve ever used. Feels super comfortable in the hand and the ratchet mechanism is so smooth. The bit storage is super convenient as well. 10/10 would recommend to anyone building PCs!

Just got it feels great with little backdrag and great quality.
"Build quality and usability are fantastic. I've bought some expensive screwdrivers but they've never felt/functioned as well as this. The force required to overcome the ratchet is minimal and you can tell that every part is made with great material. \nThe only reason I'm removing a star is the fact that there's no good way to store additional bits. Yes, I'm sure there are systems out there or I could 3d print something, but it's a shame that a product as well thought out as this didn't get consideration for extra bit storage. I basically want to replace my iFixit kit but simply can't because I'd end up with a Ziploc of bits. \nIf a resolution is given, I'd buy it immediately and up my rating to 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic product. Just keep in mind that if you're a weirdo like me who has used every bit ever you might have to put more thought into it."
I build all of my friends PCs plus my households and work on other activities. I would rather use Linus' screwdriver than any other screwdriver.
I use this to build and upgrade PCs and I am massively impressed.
"The build quality, feel, magnetic force, and ratchet are all excellent. I've already recommended it to several friends and coworkers. \nI use it to take apart PCs at work to remove their drives and destroy them for recycle. I have yet to find a PC that can't be easily disassembled using this screwdriver. We have iFixit kits at work as well but I usually choose to use this screwdriver instead because of its superior magnet and feel.\nMy one and only nitpick: I needed to remove a server from its rack and the handle got scratched against some piece of metal. The material of the handle scratched easier than I expected and the scratch is noticeable full circle around the handle. \nThe screwdriver is still fully functional and feels good: still the best one I've ever used."

"Lovely screwdriver, it became my favourite tool in the house. Unfortunately I dropped it from ~6 feet and while it was closed it still damaged one of the pins that hold bits. Can’t blame LTT for this but this pins are too weak."
need i say more
The best feature of this tool was the backforce for me. I'm so used to struggling on the last bit of unscrewing and just turning the whole screwdriver (not using the ratcheting mechanism). It was an odd feeling to be able to just fully unscrew something without the slight struggle at the end. then it just stays on the end of the screwdriver! The strength of the magnet can be annoying sometimes it will attract to unintended things but id certainly rather have a strong magnet then one that doesnt hold on to screws.
I've owned a fair few driver kits of various types. Never had one that felt THIS good in the hand. Build quality is apparent the moment you feel it.
"Every aspect of this thing works FLAWLESSLY. The ratchet is both extremely useful with its crazy low back force and very pleasing to just use.  Magnets are perfect, durability is outstanding. "

"The ease of use, simple storage for bits and great quality made me so happy that I spent the extra to get it to the UK and use it first hand, btw brought other products all of which the highest of quality."
"Awsome screwdriver. I use it everday at work. i work on hazard detection systems and for screwing.\nThe only issue is, my cat doesnt like the Screwdriver🤣\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/GttGLfVEx4g?feature=share"
I wish I could give the product the 5 stars it really deserves. The quality of craftsmanship is clear and visible and I have no problems with the actual product. I was however unhappy with my order/delivery experience. when I ordered the screwdriver I also ordered a set of torque bits for a project I was working on. The screwdriver arrived but the bits never did. Meaning I had to delay my project until I could find the bits elsewhere. I have since ordered the bits again. As I've never had good experiences with refunds and I genuinely enjoy the screwdriver a lot. 
"I bought this to build a new PC, which delivered on all of its promised features. No issues; it's sturdy and has everything I need in a screwdriver."
"Been using a vessel for the past few years, Did not want to spend the $$$ on this but very glad I did. Very solid driver. Need to order all the diff bits at some point."

good
I have used this screwdriver for everything from working on my computer to building furniture and it is fantastic at both. I love it so much I got one for my dad for Father's Day
"I am a 30 plus year user of the Snap on screwdriver, sadly it has just gone missing, so I brought one of these Ltt screwdrivers. \nI won't compare it to the Snap On, they are very different but very comparable at the same time.\nWhat I will say is I haven't missed the Snap On since getting this screwdriver and I like using it.\nI went to buy another Snap On and it is well over double the price of this screwdriver.\nVery nice to operate as far as the tips go and their storage and also the ratchet is also very nice.\nI contemplated for quite a while but now very glad I brought one.\nThank You"
"As an avid user of the iFixit kit, getting tired of lugging around bits misplacing them, and downright just forgetting the kit. I was elated having everything in the palm of my hands. It’s my first ratcheting device and as someone that primarily repairs laptops, and televisions, and PCs it’s perfect. The only wish I had is there being an option with thinner shaft or longer bits. As some laptop rear shells are too recessed and the bits are too wide. The bottom mechanism also just spins freely and loosely now which can be frustrating but, I’ve also aggressively used it since purchasing so more likely something I caused. Super happy and will be buying more products!"
I mainly use the screwdriver for working on my bike and for day to day tasks at home. With all the bit sets it is the only tool I need. It‘s very high quality and I‘m very pleased

"While i had no doubt this would be a fantastic screwdriver, my only corncern was how much it would weigh. To my delight the weight of it was perfect in every way. Aside from that its great in every way i can think of"
"I'll be honest, I bought into the hype and some of the meme of the screwdriver. I genuinely didn't expect it to be this good.  The ratchet is excellent and makes tightening and loosening very easy. The handle is also very comfortable for someone with medium sized hands. It's my go-to for Ikea furniture. It works well with computer components but for building in some cases, I found it to be a little too large. Very happy with my purchase and may by more as gifts."
Love it. Worth every penny
"Tbh, I didn’t really need such a nice screwdriver, and I already knew that before I ordered. I use a screwdriver maybe once a month, but I was fully on the hype train and rationalized it with a couple big pieces of IKEA furniture I knew I’d be building soon. It worked great for that of course, as it did for opening up my gaming laptop to update the firmware of a new M.2 drive before installing it in my PS5, and for installing a new door-closer (yes that’s what they’re actually called) on my screen door. It’s a joy to use, such sweet overkill. Super premium feel, buttery smooth ratcheting, effortless bit changing; all the things you’ve heard Linus repeatedly dote on haha, it’s totally worth the the price. The bits are pretty easy to round off with user error, but I prefer that to rounding off hard to find sized screws, especially when the replacement bits are so cheap to replace, and of course you can use any bits you already own too. The shaft magnet is incredibly strong, those bits are not coming out unless you deliberately pull at them, and ferrous screws even fight not to be transferred one-handed to a magnetic parts tray. Bottom line: I won’t be getting the stubby or a new color way unless something happens to this one, but one is totally worth it even for occasional use. And I’ll be getting another one for my uncle’s birthday who’s a retired mechanic that still loves tinkering, perfect gift for the people like that in your life."
"Overall it’s a great ratcheting screwdriver with some goods perks, but I had some minor things I didn’t like. "

The best ratcheting screwdriver on the market. Thank you LTT crew.
Even though I have rather large hands - the screwdriver felt surprisingly good in both of them.
"The hype lived up to my expectations and more.  I have put away my manual screwdrivers and made this my go to for both tech projects and around the house repairs.  I know when the next round comes out, i will be adding another so I can keep my tech and home repair drivers separate because I am always searching for where I left it last."
"I've purchased a number of ratcheting screwdrivers in the past. Despite spending decent money I've always been unhappy with them. The LTT screwdriver has a number of features that really make it stand out such as the magnet which is extremely strong and better than anything else I've seen. Build quality is excellent and the ratchet quality is so good you'd think it was designed by Germans rather than Canadians. I really have no criticism for the product, outstanding."
Haven’t received it

"Well worth the wait and price, yes it’s expensive but the quality of the screwdriver compared similar screwdrivers the LTT one is overall much better."
"I use it daily, one of my favorites so far.\n+ No Bullshit Design, no fiddly parts (Yes, I mean you, WERA)\n+ Nice size, if you have big hands like me\n+ Strong Magnet\n+ Great Ratchet, feels perfect\n+/- Bits aren't standard size and only average quality (Replace them and your made)\n+/- Cover of the Bitholder is pretty soft, good to hammer delicate parts into place, but doesn't withhold that much pressure\n- Torque limiter missing\n- No removable/changeable Magnet\n- No ESD Certification, no CE Certification, therefore problematic to use in professional environment/industry, luckily my Boss doesn't care."
I am truly enjoying the fact that I only have to take one tool.  As an IT professional I would have to carry a small tool kit.  Now I only carry the LTT Screwdriver.
I like it a lot. It feels really good in the hand.
It’s simply the best screwdriver

Zero stars..never got it they shipped it 3 times and everytime it got lost. What a joke.
it drives screws well
Works well. Extremely functional.
"It took me a while to be convinced of the quality and value of the screwdriver. I guess it was only after watching Project Farm's review and comparison that I decided to buy it. Though it's on the expensive side for me, the quality more than makes up for the cost. It's easily one of the best tools I've ever had—super nice!\nHowever, I did face a bit of a hiccup when the Brazilian customs office inexplicably sent back the screwdriver without any reason. The original tracking number stopped providing updates after a few months after ordering the screwdriver. Fortunately, I contacted the LTT support staff after this incident, and they were really helpful and cool. They provided me with the option to get a refund, store credit, or to have another one sent to me. I chose to have another screwdriver sent, which arrived around 40 days later.\nWas it worth the wait? Absolutely, yes."
"I wouldn't drop it, the plastic that holds the bits in the handle is not the strongest stuff, but for light tosses, even a drop off a desk it should be fine. The ratcheting mechanism is great, feels wonderful in your hand too. To say it's among the best drivers I've used in 30+ years wouldn't be selling it short or putting it too high, it deserves this place."

"Hands down this is the best screwdriver I’ve ever used. Makes jobs around the, repairs building new furniture much more enjoyable. I purchased a Bosch bit pack and every bit works with the screwdriver. We recently moved so I’ve been able to put this to a great deal of use in the last little bit. Very impressed."
"Have been waiting for it so long, not disappointed! Amazing packaging, build quality and love the mechanism."
Very satisfying to use. Used it to install my new case fan. Plastic handle feels great.
"Great for everything, not just for computers. Easy to use without applying much force. Should've bought all the bits at once instead of later."
"Sturdy shaft, very sturdy, great for screwing 🤤"

"I Purchased this cause I needed a screwdriver set for pc builds, but it works even greater then expected."
"I bought one for myself and one for my dad as a Father's Day gift. He was a mechanic most of my life, before retirement he had actually gone back to school and was working in a clean room putting together wiring for BAE (they made missile cannisters)"
"Very good, the action is good and the ratcheting is cool, the bit storage is a \""bit\"" to be desired, would have been cool to be able to store more standard size bits, I use a handful of odd bits that arnt in the ltt pack outs, so would have been cool to be able to store a few more standard size bits , but have to carry the driver and a baggy with bits "
Sturdy handle and nice smooth driver with a nice sound. It delivers on the promise.
"I received my LTT screwdriver a month and a half ago and promptly used it to fix all manner of things. We know from reviews that the bit holder is a bit weak if abused, so I have been careful with it and have not had any issues. "

Absolutely love these screwdrivers! Has to buy another 2 after I bought my first one!
"Almost keep it on me all the time.\nGreat for fixing my glasses, bicycle, computer, and probably anything I can ask for.\nOne thing I would like is to have a choice of bits when buying the screwdriver, so if I need a second one, I can get different bits."
Good tool
The screwdriver is nothing short of fantastic. Handle is great for grip. Kneeling is nice to use. Overall a fantastic product.
I tinker with computers a lot and have never loved my screwdrivers. This screwdriver has been so nice to use and so convenient that I always pack it when there's even a remote possibility that I'll need it. It's ruined other screwdrivers for me

"I bought this as a gift and the recipient was so excited. They took their time over the packaging and admired the construction. Then eagerly showed it off to everyone, found reasons to use it, and keeps it to hand all day as a fidget tool. Well, that and just in case a screw looks loose...."
It's perfectly suited to IT needs. It's a purpose built tool for a specific task. It was totally worth the $$ and the wait.
"Love it! Use it all the time... Sometimes look for excuses just to be able to use it, and the magnet is very strong... Definitely worth it!"
Must have tool in my backpack as an IT professional
"I always hated electric screwdrivers as they very quickly destroy screw heads. And the non-ratcheting ones are very slow to use, especially if I need a hand to hold the screw. With this one I get most of the speed of electric screwdriver but also fine control over speed and torque so I don't damage the screws and bits. Easy recommendation, though after VAT and shipping costs to the EU it is really expensive, so even If I recommend it to friends and family most of them won't buy it and I can't blame them."

Just perfect! \nToo bad I bought it 1 week before the noctua one was announced :( just after installing full noctua in me nee pc… ah well
"Listened to Linus tell us how great this screwdriver is and was thinking of purchasing one, but after Project Farm tested it I decided to try one. I've been a mechanic for almost 50 years and have owned multiple Snap-on ratcheting drivers since it was introduced. The LTT driver puts the Snap-on driver to shame. This is the best ratcheting driver I've used, with the attention to small details an added bonus. First purchase from LTT but won't be my last."
The best tool I own
"When you're dealing with fiddly/small screws, the extremely low torque ratchet is a match made in heaven."
It has been nice to have on hand. I got one for me and my step dad who also enjoyed theirs.

Excellent screwdriver!
I like it so far. The ratchet feels very nice and you can more or less use it from the get go.\nA perfect 5/7 (who gets that meme? 😁)
You’ll never be happy with a normal screwdriver again. 10/10 recommend. The videos showcasing the screwdriver hold true and give an excellent look at what it’s like using one.
This screwdriver is everything it needs to be. It is not a sonicscrewdriver which can hack and close black holes. It is just a good screwdriver.
10 out of 10 would buy again. Great quality and the back drag is so low makes starting screws very easy.

"I work as an irrigation technician and use this screwdriver about 3 times a day and I love it. The light backforce, and strong magnetic holding force is amazing."
"I know it’s expensive guys, but the bits it comes w are basically all you need. If you need more get a bit box and they’ll fit in the screwdriver you’ll just have to carry less bits onboard"
I used it on my truck and didn't injure myself
"I bought this one night while I was dunk along with the WAN deskpad, I was gutted I spent £70 on a screwdriver. once it arrived I though £50 tops, then I used it to build 2 PCs and WOW it's actually worth every penny!!! totally amazing so good in the hand and never used a ratchet like it before. Thanks for making this..."

I personally work on cell phone repair and other electronics repair and this is my daily driver screwdriver it works great for me
"I really do love this screwdriver.  The ratcheting mechanism is excellent, most needed bits come with it, magnets are the best.  All in getting one here to California ended up costing me just under $90, which is crazy expensive, but there is no denying that this is a quality product."
"Really satisfying to use, works great"

"Been using the screwdriver for about 2 months now, I use it at home, bring it to work, and I have all the bits I need! I really like the bit storage and that ratchet feels so good! I definetly recommend this screwdriver to anyone."
"This thing is outstanding. Everything feels perfect, from the finish to the ratcheting mechanism's sounds and feels to the knurling to the ease with which you can switch between ratchet modes. They put a lot of work into this screwdriver and it shows. I would recommend this screwdriver to anyone who will ever find himself needing to drive screws of any kind."
"Delighted with my screwdriver. \nRatchet is smooth and sounds great, handle is very comfortable and is surprisingly tough. I have dropped it multiple times and it only has a couple of scuffs that IMHO just give it more character. As many people have already mentioned it is a great fidget toy."
"I love the ratchet on this driver. It is so smooth and satisfying that I find I use it more as a fidget while sitting at my desk than as an everyday tool. Probably because I don’t need a screwdriver everyday, but that’s beside the point. This is a seriously high quality tool that is my go to driver for most tasks. And, it seems, my unconscious go to fidget as well. \nGreat tool, high quality, highly recommended. Worth the price."
"Well happy with it, I didn't think I'd need an expensive screwdriver but it is amazing!"

"Fantastic Tool, Great for Jobs around the house and Awesome for PC Builds."
"Very sturdy and ergonomic! Would have loved to have 2 pozidriv bits instead of the 2 square ones (maybe Linus would consider an “EU version” of the screwdriver that comes with this as a standard loadout? Don’t know if it’s possibble, but here’s to hoping :) ).\nOther than that, the shipping costs to the EU were almost half the price of the order but I understand that logistically, that’s unlikely to get better in the near future. All I can wish LTT is that you guys become big enough to make that happen, since you do have a lot of European fans and followers that love your stuff!\nKeep up the good work and making good quality products!\nP.S. I missed the “free shipping”, otherwise I’d have definitely contributed more to burning a hole in Linus’ pockets :))"
"Bought one and could not be happier with the purchase. Build quality is premium and durable. I have used it for about 6 months and build/repaired 4 computers, replaced a door, and countless other DIY projects around the house. Plus in the off time it's a fidget spinner on my desk."
Order this for my boyfriend for Father's Day and he absolutely loves it.
This screwdriver is well worth the price. I work in the appliance repair business and use the screwdriver every day. It is very handy and easy to use with one hand. The magnetic bits are great along with the bit storage. Cannot recommend enough!!!

Best screw driver I've ever used. Perfect for building pcs + anything else.
"I’ve been using the LTT screwdriver for some time now, and I really like it. You can tell that LTT put every effort into creating a very good tool. The handle/grip is very nice to your hands and gives very good grip.\nOne minor downside is that the small bits are not usable in other tools because of their small size"

"I work for a security company and we do installs of camera equipment. I bought one of these screw drivers because I got tired of the terrible quality tools the camera manufacturers ship us. I loved it so much that I use it for literally everything. My boss saw and he himself a technician of over 20 years of experience told me to buy one for everyone including a few as a backup. Everyone I give the screwdriver to, they marvel at it and breath a sigh of relief every time they find a feature. It's handy, durable, bits are good quality, and has everything you would need. Not to mention the design itself is nearly perfect, giving you exactly what you need when you need it; the knurling is well designed, the body is durable, the bits are easy to swap and manage, and it's overall a perfect fit. No longer do we have to carry toolbelts; just take the screwdriver in your back pocket and you're set. "
"Feels amazing and works even better, the back force really is something special."
My husband absolutely loves it.
"I love this screwdriver. It comes in at $70, which seems a bit pricy, but it is an exceptional quality screwdriver. Everything I wanted from it, it had."
"Really the LTT ratchet screwdriver. I have I've used many through the years for building computers and in my job, I am a caretaker for an academy of schools but I do so much more. I do all its network runs and electrical work find it so useful and versatile own many products like this as well as specialized ones but this one just seems to have so much versatility and is so nice to use. Even when putting furniture together I really like how it feels in the hand and the little force it takes to use the ratchet as, with many other screwdrivers you have to put so much force on them to activate it. It is a really good fidget toy as well!"

"I used this screwdriver for the past month and I have to say that it replaced all my old screwdrivers. I hated that my old one would get stuck in the ratcheting or you had to carry an additional box filled with bits. With the LTT, I dont have to. It's all in one and the ratcheting is great. \nThe magnetic bits are amazing! Screws don't fall off. \nThe price is high. I do have to say I thought the handle would feel better but it feels cheap. It isn't. I've dropped this thing a few times and it hasn't cracked luckily. "
Very nice and balanced as described. Vfm also in my opinion.
"Bought this when I had enough money to do so, and it's definitely the best screwdriver I've used. My only other experience with a ratcheting screwdriver was a stubby length one where the bits were loose in the handle and would rattle around, and to be honest I barely used the ratcheting function of that screwdriver because most of the time it seemed to be less efficient than just using it manually (eventually I just started using the non-ratcheting one bundled in with my \""be quiet!\"" CPU cooler for normal Philips head screws because of the longer length). The LTT screwdriver uses a much more sophisticated bit storage design, and the backforce is *so light*. I love this thing."
Didn’t use it for a pc but built all my IKEA fourniture with it since I settled in Canada ❤️
"I've had a problem with my wrist since I finished high school due to drumming for 7 years. This screwdriver does not fix my wrist pain. BUT it is the only screwdriver I can use without the certainty of pain. I just used it to move and disassemble furniture, and quite honestly I couldn't have done it without it. So thank you to all the people in creator workshop and LTT that made this happen."

"I still enjoy using the product. It's useful and easily accessible to swap bits interchangeably when needed. The soft plastic feel makes it feel great in the hand, but it's a tad too large in some cases. I am still amazed at just how good the build quality is. Satisfying clicking sound, soft in the hand, great weight to it, etc. Very impressed and shouldn't be that surprised being that I order a lot from this site and only great materials are used."
"It's a pretty good screwdriver. I don't use it much, but when I do, it's much easier to grab it off my desk instead of rummaging through my toolbox to find the multiple ones I might need. It's also a fun fidget toy. If only I could get a precision screwdriver just like it..."
"While I do think that $70 is too much money for a screwdriver, I can't deny how good a product it is. The only question now is, how long will it last?"
Great grip and perfect tool to a variety of odd jobs around the house or while working with electronics.  \nThe price might be high compared to a basic one but the quality and overall experience with it make it worth it
"I didn't know what was all the fuss about that screwdriver. I read the features, saw the price and went await.\nAnother day, I wanted to try anyway, so I did it."

"I can't see myself settling for anything cheaper than this again. The shaft doesn't wobble and the back-force is really low. The knurling is deep and positive but not uncomfortable to use. This really is about as good as it gets, and normally I Stan Vessel (made in Japan) drivers"
"So it's been about maybe 1 ½ months using the screwdriver and I was enjoying, I always switch between screw bits, and today the holder just came out completely 🥺"
The screwdriver is nuts. Buy it.
Best magnetic tips I've experienced. The only main gripe would be the handle quality which feels cheap and has no real grip. Apart from that a quality set. For PC building though this would rarely be an issue unless someone over torqued a screw.
"This thing is brilliant. The ratcheting mechanism is perfectly tuned, the magnet is super grippy and the bit holder can be used as a fidget toy. It's not the cheapest around but worth the price."

"been using this around the house for odd jobs and such and its been plenty nice, until yesterday I had to rebuild my pc to change a couple things. LTT screw driver was the perfect length to unscrew my noctua cooler down through the heat sync, and the magnetic strength through the phillips bit was strong enough to lift everything I unscrewed with it."
"I love everything about it, especially the knurling on the shaft"
"Feels great, I got the all black and it looks great. Magnets are crazy strong. Got mine and loved it so much, I ordered my dad another one for Father’s Day."
Got one as a gift and thought it had been stolen….immediately bought a replacement. Found the first had been “borrowed” and slow in returning. Now I have two. Love this screwdriver.

I haven’t used it too much but it feels great. The crank mechanism is so buttery smooth compared to other screwdrivers I have used.
Expensive but worth it the second my hands touched it.
Expensive but by far the best screwdriver I've ever used.\nDefinitely designed around low back pressure on screw tightening. Excellent as an general use screwdriver and especially PC building/dismantling.\nThe only thing I'd change is in the default bits given - The 2 Robinson (Square) bits are an odd choice and would prefer a couple of more common size security torx bits instead.\nOtherwise fantastic.
"Got this screwdriver for my boyfriend and he loves it and I love it! When he expressed his need for a screwdriver I was like boringggg but it turns out I haven’t stopped flipping it in my hand or playing with the ratchet (which btw, is the most satisfying sound EVER). Very satisfied with this screwdriver/girlfriend appeasing toy!"
Works great. The light ratcheting mechanism is especially good to dismantle sensitive electronics.

"It's expensive, no doubt. But I, a casual tinkerer, and my friend, a full-time mechanic, love this thing. Only worry is the bit storage clips breaking. Bought two, one for me (black shaft lesgoo) and one for my friend (his fiancé also loves it)."
This thing is amazing! Buy one you will not regret it. I wish ltt made more products because they are great and priced well!
"From working on my car, to jet ski to machines at work; its consistently been the first tool I reach for from my bag."
Can only complain about the somewhat limited number of default bits. Otherwise fully satisfied with the product!
"Great tool, satisfying clicks"

"I used to thought screwdriver don't need to be fancy, just turn  better. But I gave LTT screwdriver a try, turned out having ratchet helps a lot than I thought.\nThough the only unsatisfied part for me was the bit storage. It would have been better if longer bits can be stored without scarifying 2 LTT bits."
"Overall, a quality product. There was slightly more axial play in the shaft than I was expecting, but that has not seemed to cause any issues with normal operation."

"Great tool, satisfying click"
"There are many commendable aspects of the Screwdriver, including its high-quality materials, strong magnet, and ergonomic shape that fits comfortably in my hand, not to mention the satisfying feeling of its ratcheting mechanism. \nHowever, there are also a couple of downsides. The shaft has slightly more play than I had hoped for, and the bit holder doesn't slide in or out smoothly.\nAll in all I am still very happy that I got it but I hope future revisions fix the issues I have on mine."

Very good
This screwdriver is truly a masterpiece. I'm obsessed with everything about this thing. I pray they make a mini one so badly. This was clearly made with extreme attention to detail and blows any screwdriver in this price range out of the water. Highly recommend because you get a great screwdriver and support an even better company!
"I am a union electrician and I always carry this screwdriver with me, the ratchet feels wonderful and the backforce is great. It has even survived many falls from a 12ft ladder which is impressive, at least in my experience. I am pleasantly surprised by how it has held up so far. It is completely worth the money as I use this almost more than any other tool in my bag."
"Oh my gosh I love this thing. My old multi-bit screwdriver was starting to fail and I was needing a new one anyway so I decided to splurge and treat myself to one of the fabled LTT screwdrivers. It does NOT disappoint! The first three days I just carried it with me everywhere and would just spin it as I walked, even at work. Then I was opening/closing the handle and the number 2 philips bit fell out at work and I couldn't find it :( I ordered a replacement set as well as a torx. Oh also, I don't take it to work any more haha Love the mechanism and can't wait for their fidget toy(s) Linus has teased."
Best screwdriver for pc building by far also used it for renovating my kitchen

"I purchased this for my BF and he advised that I am the best person in the world and that this is the best present ever. It’s well made, sturdy and the sound and feeling you get when you are screwing around is superlative."
"Linus didn't over sell it. It's very well crafted, very well balanced, tension on the ratcheting is great! Fits in your hand very well, and I love the bottom slot that holds all of the bits. I will probably only use those bits in a bind because I have my preferred set. But they are not bad for quick one off quick job. The only thing I could say that might be bad about it, Is that the clips that hold in the bits seem like they're kind of fragile? But I probably won't worry about that because I won't use them that often. Really good job guys. Love the screwdriver!"
"The screws around here have never been driven like this. High quality stuff, love how the bits are stored inside yet it's quite compact."
I got this for my husband for Father's day and he was ecstatic. He had been hinting about this screwdriver for months at that point. He immediately looked around the house to find something he could use it on. He literally screwed a screw into the side of a cardboard box to see how quickly it would start ratcheting and it started threading the screw into the box as soon as the tip went in so that was cool. He keeps trying to find stuff around the house that requires a screwdriver and honestly it's adorable. I'd say the product works great. The magnetic tip is nice to have and it is indeed perfectly balanced.
Bought them for my Dad and brother after how much I loved mine. Such a high quality product and I’m happy to support a business I’ve been watching for years.

"It does what it needs to do. And it does it while bringing a smile on my face, making me happy and helping me forget all my troubles. I am now able to survive anything live throws at me. The screwdriver is my buddy, my lifeline, my reason to exist."
"A pretty nice screwdriver but it’s incredibly slick if dirt, dust, liquids get on the handle. "
"Nice tool, good compromises."
I have many tools and I can confidently say that this screw driver is now my daily driver!

"I have been fixing up my old house, selling it and moving to a new house and starting to fix that one up. The screwdriver has come in clutch for all of that. I kept it in my pocket and it was my go-to for everything but electrical things (for obvious reasons). Having a hex bit set was so nice because a lot of furniture uses them, way better than cheap Allen Keys. In my old house, prior owners used whatever screw types they had lying around, so it was nice that I could easily change between Flathead and Phillips easily as I went around."
We used this screwdriver to put our daughter's big girl bed together. So much easier than an allen wrench. The magnet is amazing for holding screws while you start them. My daughter loves closing the cap on the end and playing with the ratcheting feature. This is the most expensive fidget I've ever bought my husband but it also works well as a screwdriver so it's worth it.
Bought as a gift for my boyfriend and he not only loves it but it also saves him so much time that even as someone who has built a lot of computers did so in half the time with this screw driver between the ￼ratchet and magnet tip I may have to buy a few more
"The screwdriver is like a sword for a knight, with it you can conquer any task. Without it you can do nothing at all. I love all of the extra bits you can purchase."
"I will start with the issue, the very strong magnet is great for holding screws and is overall a great feature but at some times it is too strong.  I was replacing the switch on my lathe and I noticed that after I set it down on the floor a bunch of metal shavings from sharpening my gouges stuck to the screwdriver, which is a minor issue, but a few days later I dropped it and it landed where a pile of just in my backyard was and the magnet sucked a whole load of rust into it meaning that with the short length for the bits it got very full and I am sure bits would not have fit in there.  This issue was fixed with an air compressor shooting some air into it.  \nAside from that minor hiccup it is a great screwdriver and 99% of the time the strong magnets is a great feature.  The ridiculous low amount of back pressure to ratchet it is lovely and you can definitely put a tonne of pressure into turning things out with no wobble, anything more and I would be taking out the impact.  The bits have nice bite out of the box and with a reasonable amount of use on new, old, painted over, and other screws they haven't got more than some finish coming off.  You are also able to swap in other random bits with no issue.\nSo is it worth the steep price tag? Well yes it is at the right price point for a high quality ratcheting screwdriver.  It is not overpriced for what it is, just may be more than you need to spend on a screwdriver.  You are also going to be spending close to this on any other screwdriver in the same quality and feature bracket."

I find for the price paid for the screw driver and the bits we should be given a proper case/storage units. The quality is good but presentation and storage is pretty bad.
"the short distance between the the ratcheting teeth is what won me over, makes life a lot easier when you're trying to work with small screws that dont need to travel far"
I dunno how many screwdrivers I've bought over the years ...no how many I own now as far as that goes.
“Why would I get this vanity purchase when a normal screwdriver does the job?” Was me before buying it. NOTE: YOU GET A SET OF BASIC BITS ALONG WITH IT.
"The global building quality is very high, but mine broke after somthing like 2 weeks of usage.\nIt is actualy the bit storage that \""unrailed\"", and now if I pull it it will vanish from the casing and won't be stoped at the end of the course.\nThe thing is, at the second I put my review online, customer service proposed to send to me a replacement unit without even asking!\nOne of the best customer seevice experience for me !"

"Ordered one of these screwdrivers to see if the long R&D was worth it and if it lived up to the hype.  So far it has been flawless.  Very smooth ratchet mechanism( much smoother than either of my s…-.n brand screwdrivers.  Bit storage is great, love that I can spin the screwdriver with the palm of my hand without worrying about a cap falling off.  Shape of the handle is great and fits my hand perfectly.  Very aggressive knurled shaft is great for use with dirty/greasy hands.  Only time will tell how it holds up in a daily commercial application but my expectations are high.  Will definitely be ordering more in the future.  Hoping for an open top bit storage system to hold all the optional bits in an easily accessible place in the toolbox.  10/10 would recommend to anyone on the fence or worried about justifying the price.  Good tools aren’t cheap and cheap tools (usually) aren’t good!"
"I'm not a proffesional. I just needed a new waterbottle for work and thought \""I don't have a *ratcheting* screwdriver.\"""
"The screwdriver works as well as I had hoped. The ratcheting mechanism was smooth to operate. The bit holder is convenient and easy to use. And the feel is so good that I fidget with it much too often. (That's autism for you.) Though the teeth are starting to grind a bit on one side more than the other, I expect this to do its job for a long time."
"I had used my screwdriver for a few weeks, just doing small things around the house and building ikea furniture. The ratchet partially failed so that at the center position it would rotate in one direction. LTT support sent a replacement for free which seems to be doing fine."
"After reading many reviews and I am happy that I bought this expensive screw driver.\nI think the handle can be more coarse. It seems a bit slippery.\nBut the length, mechanism, ratcheting, bits, and magnetic, are all superb.  99% there."

"No buyers remorse here, it screws things real good."
"I ordered this screwdriver for my deployment team for a server refresh and one for myself and I have to say that I got exactly what I paid for. The strength of the magnet made screwing into the rack with one had holding the devices up is a godsend. I'm also a huge fan of the intuitive ratchet, great call Linus. Would be a certified 5 star if it came with a #3 phillips out of the box but since I can't do 4.5, 5 stars it is."
This screwdriver is by far the best gift I've ever given my wife. She was over the moon for it. I think it saved our marriage!\nThank you for a great product!

"Never really took screwdrivers into much consideration, aside from the iFixIt kits I knew were great for computer and electronics specifically. Since I always saw everyone else using regular standard screwdrivers, and the only specialty ones I owned either had flashlights or fancy holders for a few bits, I never imagined anything better. When LTT showed this, it sparked some interest, but I never thought I'd enjoy using it and question why I never considered getting something better long ago. Aside from working on computers and electronics, I do some woodworking, car body repair work, and handy work around my home, which this screwdriver has made much easier and feels better to do than using regular screwdrivers. "
The LTT screwdriver is very well designed. If you’re looking for a quality screwdriver you can’t look anywhere else. (As long as you don’t mind the price)
Best screwdriver
"A great screwdriver, magnetic tip is top-notch, rotation lock works without problems. Originally bought it to support LTT, but now it seems to be really practical.\nNo regrets, well only one, now I have urge to buy Ikea things so I can screw all day long .. Hopefully, I will not screw it all or will I?"
This is a wonderful screwdriver. Was worth the purchase and the ability to show it off to my friends in awe.

"There's not much to say about the LTT screwdriver that hasn't already been said. LTT said they put every single tiny but under the microscope to make sure that no detail was missed and it was as perfect & built to as high a standard as possible, and it shows. The materials, build & features reflect a level of care in the overall process of designing & producing a product that I wish applied to everything. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that if every company approached delivering their product like this, it'd literally save the world."
"I'm an electrician and have been using multi bit screwdrivers for decades. This is the most ergonomic, versatile, easiest to use ratcheting driver I've ever used. My only complaint is that the stubby version isn't out yet, as that will be even more perfect."
"My only complaint is the amount of force needed to pull the bit holder out sometimes forces it off of the center shaft it is held by, but otherwise it is very sturdy and I’ve put it through its paces!"
"I was watching the development of the LTT screwdriver with mild intrigue when Linus first started talking about it; I wasn't particularly in the market for a ratcheting screwdriver nor did I feel like I needed one. Fast forward a rather long while and I am absolutely blown away by this product and recommend it to anyone who wants a quality driver. Particularly if you're using a screwdriver in a semi or fully professional capacity, then do yourself a favour and invest in this driver; this tool competes with the big brands in my opinion. "
"Love the bit storage built into the handle, The slight magnetic pull , the weight distribution and the sensitivity of the rachet"

"Delivery was faster than it said on the website. Considering it coming to Germany it was pretty fast. I forgot to add an item to my package and didn't notice so I contacted the support. They were kind enough to refund part of the shipment costs since they shipped it faster than they reacted to my email. The product itself is definitely high quality and as described by Linus himself. The other product was the deskpad and it is really nice as well. Thicc material, nice and smooth surface. Very good experience overall."
"Delivery was pretty slow to Delaware US but it's okay I suppose for international one. Also screwdriver box was smashed inside and a little teared which is not great, but, again, maybe it's delivery problems, not LTT.\nQuality of screwdriver is woooow so awesome, I like it so much, especially that ratcheting sound, it's better than a fidget toy!"
"I bought one to use on my project car, the design is great and looks cooler than most other screwdrivers on the market, plus it can be used on my PC too as another benefit."
"I've had the same rationing screwdriver since I purchased it for myself back when I was in high school. After losing it in a flash flood in 2021, I'd been looking for a new ratcheting screwdriver. Being a lover of linus tech tips, and hearing all about the screwdriver that could be found at LTTstore.com, I knew I had to try it. It. I do not regret this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new screwdriver to use."
"Everything about the screwdriver, the ratchet, the magnet, the bit storage, and the shape made regular screwdrivers unbearable.\nFor everyday use and computers this screwdriver has improved in areas i didn’t know I needed but can’t live without.  The best way I can describe how game changer this is, is when i was working on my cars stereo with my cousin and I carry a simple screwdriver in my car to remove it so it doesn’t get stolen, nonetheless my cousin forced me to go and get my ltt screwdriver because he was annoyed at the basic screwdriver making everything so hard."

"Where can I get a black shaft , I need one."
My husband told me about this and then forgot about it so it was a huge hit for his birthday. He loves it and recommends it to anyone that’ll listen!
"I thought this would make an excellent father's day gift. Wasn't crazy expensive for what it is, that's about all from me. My dad absolutely loves it. You can tell a lot of thought went into this tool. He loves the strong magnets, he loves the handle bit holder and he loves that it doesn't feel cheap even though there's plastic on it. The bits seem to be high quality and don't bend like the cheap bits do. I'm sure the screw driver should hold up as Linus seems to have tested the ever loving bejesus out of it and included integral parts were made of extremely high quality steels lile sg2, which is a steel typically used in high end japanese knives. Kudos to those that worked on this tool. You have future sold me on a few of these as a fantastic gift for any trade guy for right at that $100 price point with shipping  and taxes."
Well this thing is excellent but I am not sure it’s 100% worth it for the price by itself. I do enjoy it and have really no complaints and I also partially bought it simply because I enjoy LTT content.
"I tried Snap-On and MegaPro, but nothing of them could compare to this basically brilliant screwdriver. It has a quick ratchet mechanism and fits into the case. It would be wonderful if the longer version of this screwdriver driver can be made with the same capabilities or swappable shanks."

I've done a lot of PC work over the years and also a lot of mechanical work as well. Gotta say I wish I had this damn thing the whole time lol. It's replaced every screwdriver I own and it's pretty much the only one I ever use.
I love it. Works perfectly. Only slight issue is sometimes some of the smaller hex bits get stuck but that is mroe of a problem with the bits then with the driver.
"I’ve owned a lot of screwdrivers. I’ve worn through, broken, and beaten almost as many. I have screwdriver sets in my car, in my basement, in my office. "
"Great Screwdriver for all day to day things, Probably the best ratcheting screwdriver I have held. The screwdriver deserves a rating of 5 but giving it a 4 because of the painful purchase processing. It makes no sense why the LTT store doesn't accept Canadian Cards, and then charges USD from canadian buyers. That's my only issue."
The amount of screwdrivers ive used with a magnet shouldnt be called magnetic. Love this one

I love the mechanism and it is perfectly tuned for light pressure and it is very precise.
"Thank you so much for making a screwdriver that helps with my tremors extremely well. No more dropped screws, the magnet is fantastic. also the back-force and the diameter and length of the shaft allow me to get into the smallest areas of my pc especially to unscrew my 3090 from the case. Thank you again for making such a great user and possibly disability friendly product and tool. 5 out of 5 for me"
It is quality and expensive and worth it!
Everything about it feels right. Will definitely buy another in the future.

It started off rocky due to my bit caddy falling out and having the second one I received having the shaft warped. They say third times a charm and it definitely was! The team who handled my emails and getting it handled with absolute professionalism is a dying trade! Thanks lttstore.com! I will forever be a customer! Love my screw driver and use it daily for my job at geek squad!
"I'll start with disclosure, I am biased, cause I wanted a ratcheting screwdriver ever since I saw Linuses orange snapon screwdriver, so this long developed better option was on my wishlist the moment I heard about it.\nFor the review itself: I keep it near me at all times because of how useful and quick it is to do the screwing.\nI almost find myself looking for reasons to use it.\nI had done furnishing around the flat using it with great success (where electric drill wouldn't work). \nI did receive it with mismatched bit set(was 1 duplicate and missing one size) but customer support lives up to expectations that I got from big L's words and I got new bit set free of charge.\nAll in all, if money is not a concern you get a great tool that doesnt feel like it's going to fall apart in a year(although time will tell)"
"It was for my boyfriends, he says it's amazing :)"
"I got this for my husbands birthday and  He absolutely loved it . Whenever it arrived, he would not stop trying to find projects to use it for . He uses it for everything … including bringing it to our daughters first birthday so he could “put her new toys together like a pro”. We are beyond satisfied with this product. He has already been telling all his friends they need to buy one too. Definitely worth buying because of its usefulness and because of how happy it made him."
The detail in this screw drive is unmatched. A trie no compromise product

"Works well, just right."
"Great screwdriver, feels amazing and strong magnet to hold the bits in place. Helped out great for my first build"
"I originally bought it because it can fit through my CPU cooler, but so far I only used it for bicycle repair/adjustment. It can hold itself in place with the magnet which is very helpful. The racheting feature is also great for fine adjustments. I wish the bit sizes would be more readable. Overall, it's awesome."
"I'm not going to get into all the technical details of low back force, great comfortable handle & the awesome bit holder as I know loads of other reviews have covered it.\nI'll just say I've recommended it to loads of people, some of which have ordered it."
"Every other screwdriver I've encountered has been inferior, looks amazing and ratchet system and bit selector are great"

"I'm no tool enthusiast, but this is one of the smoothest and most satisfying ratcheting screwdrivers I've used. I've used it for over a month now for auto, PC and networking services, and I can say it's a very nice tool to keep in a pocket. Definitely not heavy duty, while sturdy enough. Can't recommend using it for rougher tasks like vehicle engines. Still, I don't get the sense that it's going to fall apart on me or break if I apply a bit more pressure. It is just light in weight, which is part of what makes it nice."
"I never review products but this one is worth a review. Uncle Linus never fails to deliver, in Uncle Linus I trust."
"I occasionally used ratcheting screwdrivers in the past and never got the point. When using the LTT one, I realized the mechanisms of the other ones just weren't good enough to be useful. Just 3 days after receiving my LTT screwdriver I had to wall-mount something at work without it, and was already missing its features."
It's pricey but I love it. The magnetic force and ratcheting system work as advertised
I really love my screwdriver! The bit holder on the top part feels like it may break if I'm not careful ... but it's held on so far. Great work team :)

"This thing is comfy, didn't think it would be worth the money but it completely is! The only sad thing is I need another one because they announced the Noctua colors, and I want a beige one. Highly recommend this purchase."
It’s handy it’s well constructed and the click is so satisfying.
This screwdriver fixed my uncles prosthetic leg on a 5 mile hike uphill both ways. Craftsmanship that could be trusted on the NASA space station and reliability that would last you through grandpa's Nam experiences. 1000/10 would recommend 👌
Just built my 13700k with a 4090 and this damn screwdriver made it real easy…especially the magnetic tip and keeping the thumb screws in place
I've been using this at work here and there and I used this to upgrade my rog ally ssd and it works really well. The magnets are strong and the fit and finish are also great. I can see this lasting me for years to come. I also like the storage method for the bits. I never lose them in my backpack since they store in the screwdriver itself. Great product and I really hope you guys keep finding and making success

"Definitely a high quality product. It likely isn’t the best valued racheting screwdriver out there but to me, you’re buying this screwdriver to support a creator you like first, and getting a very high quality, useful product with it."
"Obviously the price of this tool is on the high side for screwdrivers.  That said, the saying, \""you get what you pay for\"" holds true with this tool.  it is nothing short of perfect for building a PC and any other task a quality screwdriver is needed.  I used to use a competing brand with a similar feature set.  This one is simply better and a lot better at that."
"Using the driver for work around the house and computer related tasks, leaves me not wanting for anything else. However when using it for astronomy/astrophotography related tasks, i do wish the thin bits would be a bit longer, maybe a set of bits that have the same bit diameter but have the bit points themselves be about twice as long (taking up two slots?) maybe…"
"I think the reason that I enjoy it so much is because it has prompted me to carry a screwdriver more in daily life. Its easy-to-organize bit storage has kept me from losing a single bit unlike some of my older screwdrivers. Phillips bit is decent though I will still probably swap it with a Snap-on ACR bit, those things are magic sometimes. I plan to order the Noctua one when it comes out. Also it is a little too smooth Hopefully the V2 has a little more texture"
Working on computers etc has been made much easier thanks to your well constructed screwdriver. Thank you for taking time to create something properly.

After using the ltt screwdriver I’m always looking for an excuse to use it again. I thought the reviews were exaggerated but it lived up to every point. Amazing quality and perfect for any situation.
"Originally I had a couple dewalt ratchet screwdrivers and a snap-on. They are all pretty decent, but there’s a bunch of tiny things about them that are annoying. "
The screwdriver feels as premium as possible and I am using it in tons of different situations. The ratchet had a perfect sound and the best gear ratio I have felt. The only downside I see is not something you can easily fix and is normal in magnetic screwdrivers. metal screws and nuts flying towards the bit and damaging the external of the barrel. its all small scratches but they slowly add up. So because of the scratch resistance 4/5
"Love the screw driver a lot, only issue so far is the coating on the bits scratch easy, and that they showed off the noctua color right after I bought it."
"I am a technician for Ford motor company and bought this screwdriver not only to support a small business but to compare with the snap on screwdriver these are my thoughts. The LLT driver is a better driver in every aspect except one, the bits. I personally find the snap on bits have a better fit on screw heads and feel nicer in quality. So for me what I use daily is the LTT driver with the snap on bits everywhere I can. If I had to buy one driver it would be the LTT and get a different bit set."

Hard to juggle heavier-duty without sacrificing weight balance. Bit size is contentious but not the end of the world. Perhaps even a removable/replaceable shaft with impact ready would be a good alternative/possibility. The rest of the mechanics are pretty good overall. Quite convenient to have/use.</td>

For comparison, Milwaukee (a fav brand and Klein; had 1 and 0 stars respectively for the ratcheting screwdrivers b/c of slop, storage breakage of Klein, and hardbjt removal on Milwaukee to name just a few that I reviewed after 4 mins this of use)\n1) would prefer the silver color for bits just like the silver shaft, as the black is wearing right off and quickly \n2) the size/number of bit is pretty much impossible to read w/ the black coating, not to mention, black coating wearing off and makes it harder. If Bit No/size a black 9r same color of the silver shaft, would be so much easier to read; &amp; for those not in construction trades and don‚Äôt know bit size by site,  Ames it quite difficult to read. So much so, I‚Äôve got 4 ppl on my crew pulling out cell camera to zoom in to see what bit size they have; especially for the ones not used daily‚Ä¶.like specially, torx, hex, Phillips bit sets that can go down to ‚Äú0-00‚Äù zies etc‚Ä¶\nLastly, having the black coating flake off into sensitive electronics can be bad; but I‚Äôve yet to have had an issue personally from this, and hope never will.\nAs I like the black, especially when receiving my multiple black shaft ‚Äòdrivers, gonna look pretty awesome! Making my total number of screwdrivers to 5 And total bit packs to  19 total, yep, that‚Äôs right; cuz when in electronics repair and definitely the trades (a sparky, GC, remodeled, &amp; doing a lot of hardware installs‚Ä¶can wear thru bits quite fast, depending on use case). If the color and stamped ‚Äúbit size/number‚Äù  being an issue‚Ä¶.5/5 all day long, and do like the fit, magnet, &amp; storage in handle more than any of my other 40 screwdrivers. Lastly, the ratchet selector mechanism is actually CORRECT and not backwards from all others, so thx Linus for pushing this feature! Otherwise, balance great, bits so easy to remove/replace in storage handle and use! My fav screwdriver to date and definitely my fav ratcheting screwdriver period!  Nothing comes close for price, features, functions, AND USING. \nNow I‚Äôm just waiting for that Srubby, and be happy to test for you, cuz having a stubby for hvac/plumbing/electrical, cabinet installs‚Ä¶.are very valuable, imo.</td>

      <td>Hey Linus, you've said on the WAN show several times that you read every review so I figured this may be the best place to make this request. Would you please look into adding JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) bits to the options for the screwdriver? On all Japanese motorcycles (and presumably cars as well?) the cross head screws and bolts that appear to be phillips are NOT that, but rather they are JIS. They look very similar, but trying to use a standard phillips driver on a JIS fastener very often results in the fastener stripping out and having to then be drilled out. As a mechanic, having the proper tool makes a big difference and I would love to make your already kickass screwdriver an even more versatile tool in my toolbox. I know I may be in the minority as it's mostly tech enthusiasts who are buying this tool, but I've been shilling it to all my fellow mechanics as it is already a well built driver that stands up to real world abuse in a mechanic shop. Thanks for hearing me out and congrats on your much deserved success!</td>

High quality product, great price, and they arrived faster than the delivery estimate. I wish I would have read the reviews closer because I was disappointed to realize that they don't include a sturdy bit holder. I assume a solution is coming from the store in the near future, but I would have been willing to pay a few extra dollars in this purchase for something more sturdy than the cardboard boxes they are shipped in.</td>

      <td>This is better than I originally thought.  Its much bigger screwdriver than I thought it would be and after using I realize why.  Bigger is so it doesn't fall out of your hand while using.  I compared it to other smaller screwdrivers I have at home and in the past the screwdrivers would fall out of my hand.  But not this one.  Also I think you should not include flat head bits in your screwdriver.  Nothing uses flat head, everything is philips or hex, TRs.  I bought the TR bits and going to replace others with it.</td>

      <td>I don't know how many times I find I need a TORX bit for something and can't seem to ever find the right one. There are 12 of them in the TORX set ranging from T3 to T30! I shouldn't have any trouble getting the right one now and is a must in my toolbox. Combined with all the bits that come with the screwdriver I have a lot of great options should I need them. The only downside I see is that the bits come in a cardboard box so it's kind of useless to store them in it. I would have loved to have the option to buy a durable bit storage box to keep them in, and I may have even picked up some additional bit packages just in case. Overall great product and has a nice range of available bits, but the storage options could have been better.</td>

I bought every bit set so that my LTT Screwdriver would be ready for whatever I throw at it. But these flimsy paper packages are not going to hold up in my tool bag. And there's nothing holding the bits in place. So if you take one out for use, the remaining bits will move around in the package, so you can't quickly place the bit back where it was maintaining order.</td>

      <td>So I use a lot of the H2 (2mm) and H2.5 (2.5mm) for RC race cars and the bits are way too loose for me. I use MIP tools for RC and they are amazing, but uncomfortable, so when I bought the LTT screwdriver I was excited that it came with 2 and 2.5mm hex bits because I didn't doubt my boi Linus about the comfort. Unfortunately the Hexes are loose and the 2mm actually measured 1.95mm on my calipers and that is bad when it comes to small screws that need to be tight for competitive RC racing. the 2.5mm bit was 2.47 and 3mm was spot on and felt great.  MIP tools use a flat sharp tip and these are more soft and rounded. Wouldn't recommend these if you need to remove some screws that have Loctite on them. screwdriver is amazing though.

A small sticker on the opening tab should have prevented this and should be easy and low cost to add.\nBesides shipping my first impressions are that these bits look and feel like good quality. \nThey're a consumable so your mileage will vary. Also 100% need a bit storage solution, I'll probably design and print my own, but not everyone has access to these sorts of tools, so purchasing one would be a nice option.\nExcited to put these bad boys to use</td>

"The Allen key set finishes off all I need for the ltt drivers and they‚Äôre top quality, love them just like I love the other bits!  As for the breadsaurus T I love it and it‚Äôs what I wear when my partner hasn‚Äôt stole it love it! Top YouTube channel and top products ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Great product, fast shipping, 10/10 recommend"

"A bit over priced but hey what isn‚Äôt nowadays? I found some that were the right size on Amazon but they lacked the type I needed so, gotta buy a whole pack just to get the couple of bits I needed."

"As advertised. Good quality, aesthetically matches the LLT screwdriver. Shipping takes a bit longer, but to be expected when involving customs."
"Standard set, mostly the same as what came with the screwdriver."
"I have noticed that some of my bits are starting to wear out from the tip, but that is totally normal wear and tear after use. I am quite happy for the paint job, cause it is still holding extremely well. Even better than iron in the tip :DDD"
"Bits are okay. They are standard, they're short to fit the screwdriver"
"Very happy with the quality and fit of these bits, I would really appreciate a JIS set (Japanese Industrial Standard) which look similar to Phillips, but are required for working on many Japanese devices, which are easily stripped by Phillips drivers."

These bits are great. Already served their purpose and am extremely happy.

"Strange that it comes with so many duplicates, but besides that, they work as they should."
"I use the driver around the house, on a farm and also around electronics. Driver itself is excellent and the backforce is so little it is easy to start screws. Magnet also nice and strong. Nerling is very nice to have. Bit holder also very good. Only negative is that the bit holder seems to be a bit crooked. Not a huge problem and i am okey with it. Also i live in europe so sending back for fixing seems too much trouble. All in all i am happy with the tool"
"It‚Äôs screwdriver bits, they screw stuff when out in a driver üëç"
They work well for my 3d printer and the black coating is pretty durable.

"I have been waiting for the metric hex bits to be back in stock and when I saw that they were I immediately bought them and a couple other packs. I have been using them almost daily for work and they have been holding up just perfectly. I don't really try to abuse, by using too much torque but they still are holding up and I expect them to continue to hold up."
"solid addition for my LTT screwdriver's toolkit, only issue is that the bits don't fit in to parts of my xbox controller, which is the only reason i purchased this set"
Happy with the quality. :)
Not bad overall. Handle is a bit small and a grippier material would have been nice for better torquing ability - the current feel seems a bit cheap but decent attempt at sleek. Hard to juggle heavier-duty without sacrificing weight balance. Bit size is contentious but not the end of the world. Perhaps even a removable/replaceable shaft with impact ready would be a good alternative/possibility. The rest of the mechanics are pretty good overall. Quite convenient to have/use.
Great quality

Love the combo of the stubby with these hex bits!
Pretty hard to find this in the States. Much better than Allen wrenches
What else is there to say. They're bits. They're black. They're short. Perfect for what they are.
An excellent set of bits that fits the screwdriver. Now just need aq good place to store them.

Great fit and finish. Arrived promptly
They are about as durable as any other screw bits.
Already own the screwdriver and OG bits. Excellent quality and cannot fault the product even if I tried.
I bought these just in case I needed them and I used them to build my new chair. It works phenomenally well and I‚Äôm planning on getting more screw bits when I get the time

Quality bits that work well with a fantastic driver. What would be really good is a case to put them in or keep them together. The cardboard box doesn‚Äôt really do it for me.
Bit are very good quality but inventory is hard cannot have all of them one shot... have to pay 3 time shipping to get them all a bit annoying they should offer choice hold until order is complete..  or a all in one package...

Super cool
Accidentally bought this thinking the screwdriver didn‚Äôt come with the set. Oops! Back up.
Awesome but set if your looking to EDC. Bits fit into my Alpaka Hub Pouch nicely. The bits are generally half the size of traditional bits and come with a nice black finish. Worth buying if you‚Äôre trying to save space.

"I use these to install radio sensors on steel structures 300 feet in the air. These work great, simple little package, but I always have the crippling fear that if I drop one, I'm spending ten dollars plus shipping to replace a single driver bit. Haven't yet though so maybe it's a good motivator, one star off the extra anxiety it has brought to my life."
"great magnetism when picking up and holding on to things. definitely has the get up and go hootspa, does 0 to 60 in under 20 seconds when driving to and from all the nifty places. Most important of all can definitely screw into the smallest of holes. it spins right round baby right round, like a record baby."
"Well, as far as screwdriver bits go, these are great.  Package was basic, which I liked, no extra waste.  The metal seems metallic.  Yup... Um, they are the advertised sizes... There, that's my screwdriver bit review... You should buy."

"There honestly isn't too much to say about these, they are good quality bits that do their job well and fit in the LTT Screwdriver. The pre-made packs are affordable and well thought out as is the minimal packaging they come in."
"Packaging is pretty basic so you'll probably want something else to store them, but the bits themselves are as high quality as you can expect from LTT."
"With this mighty weapon, i will slay any who oppose me!!"
"Do I believe these bits and the screwdriver are the greatest ever & better than every other items, not saying that, but I'm thrilled with all the bits & I've used most of them on a daily basis. My dad's birthday is coming up & I'll be buying him all the bits & the screwdriver."

I love these. I bought a nice little storage container for these on Etsy since LTT doesn't have one. Very nice and useful bits.
They look cool and their compact size makes them perfect for my mini etc tool kits.

A set of really well made mini bits. Shorter than regular bits and great for every day carry (EDC). Responsive customer service!
"So listen, I love my LTT screwer. He's a fine, purdy boy, but he was lacking flexibility. Wouldn't ya know it, this bit set came up just like the jazzercise class he needed to loosen up and have even more utility! Now instead of acting like he's wearing girl pants with no pockets, he's got the potential of a JNCO jean with 10 cargo pockets (without the strange ICP/jiggalo Dad-like vibe). These bits just fits. Now I will sits. I am a cat."
"The bits are great, high quality, lots of variety there.  No complaints.  But if you lose the paper holder, then you're SoL.  Would be nice to have a container or holder to place them in.  I know, it's a cost thing.  But it'd be nice if you had a deluxe version or a separate case to put them in."
Best
These bits are great and go with the fantastic screwdriver. I seriously just look for ways to use them they are so enjoyable

"I accidently welded one of my screwdriver tips to a screw while mains were still on. Ruined the bit, but the screwdriver held up nicely."
Got the screwdriver and all available sets of bits. Not much I can‚Äôt take apart now. The bits live in an Altoids tin with an insert from thingiverse. So far no damage to any bits and I have extras of common ones.
"strong magnet, good bits.  satisfying to use.  Just waiting for the torx bit set now"
"They show some wear in tear on the coating, but the fits are good and the corners are holding up because of it. I expect these to last me a while and when they do start to wear, the price is still good."
"Been using the LTT screwdriver for a couple months now, no real complaints. The black coating has started to wear off on some of the bits, but I expected that. Every other black bit from other drivers I've had do the same. None have broken yet either. Am satisfied."

Just needs a decent rubberised bit holder with clearly readable and real tough wearing identifiers.  would happily pay more if it included the holder.
As far as I can tell these seem to be just as good as my dewalt bits and much better than my harbor freight bits. I plan to get the metric and imperial hex bits to finish off my set. As a maker/tinkerer I use bits (and ltt driver) a fair bit for taking things apart and fixing things etc. I even used the tiny t6 torx with no issues. I'm sure I could strip the screw before the bit would give.
"As usual, LTT is crushing it with top-quality products.  Just wish they sold something to keep them all in."
Just needed 2 bits from it but I also bought another screwdriver for work that uses different sized bits than what I use at home

Screwdriver Bit Set
I enjoyed mine so much that I bought this second one for my dad.  Both get used all the time and put my other ratcheting screwdrivers to shame.
"I ordered all of the bit sets, together with the screwdriver, a few months ago.\nAll bits look great and look like they're great quality."
"I bought these for use on electronics and hydraulic gear. They are all sized correctly and the selection is good for general use. The bluing does start wearing off after the first use, but the bits don't seem to be affected."
I ordered this a few days after the screwdriver and soon after received it a week later. Its been 2 months and I still haven't gotten the screwdriver so I haven't had a chance to use the bit set

"Good product. Stable and feels like good quality. Great design on the packaging but lazily made. Lack of filling in the packaging makes things get thrown around inside the box so not much was in their packaging when it arrived. Luckily the outermost cardboard box held tight as there were bits all over the place in the box. in addition to that, an extremely long delivery time to the point where I didn't think the order had gone through and later I forgot I had ordered it at all.\nBut no complaints about the product itself, definitely worth the money when you want something extra delicious."
Now I just need to come up with a compact case storage option.
"Seems like great bits, havent recieved my driver yet but have used with another driver and seem strong.... wish their were more hollow ground flat bits tho, as i work with alot of different size flats, and i wish their were a hole bit pack dedicated to flat, the bits i ordered are great tho...  havent broke an allen yet so thats a plus...."
Good selection of bits for almost all needs.
"The bit set works wonderfully and has enough of each bit that I need. The reason I gave four stars is because the holder it came with does not keep the bits orderly once one or more are removed. So, it can't be used as a long term storage. Overall though, I would buy this set again!"

"I do laptop repairs and I use the strong magnetic to hold the small screws until I put them on in my fix it lid. I used to put them in my hand and they would and they would sometimes fall out, but now I don't have to worry about that. The rachet also makes my job 10x faster!"

Screwdriver Bit Set
"This is a novel foray into genuine design, and its very very good. Does an excellent job. In the ratchetting space it is probably the best (for electronics and finishing work). Some minor revisions are called for to make it even better, but as a first product in what is sure to be an epic line of tools, this is a winner. Price-wise, we are paying for the startup of a sincere effort to take a merch store into a design studio, but given the commitment shown by LTT to provide great customer service, I have every confidence we are getting value going forward."
"This driver is great.  Comfy, sturdy, the ratchet is tight.  This replaced a ton of junk screwdrivers.....except for the really small ones.  Hint hint Linus."
I got every bit they sell and I‚Äôm glad I did. Strong and perfectly sized. Quality af
"The bits are fine. They were a little greasy coming out of the box, which is probably good so they don't rust, but have a rag ready. I 3d printed a gridfinity holder for them."

"Great build quality, I especially like the knurling and sensitive ratcheting action.\nComes with a good assortment of bits, but I purchased all of the other bit sets.  My only suggestion would be to provide a way to store and organize the additional bit sets."
The bits seem strong and of good quality. There is a pretty good selection but Pozidriv bits are a big blindspot. Would also love to see a proper bits holder for all the bit-sets
This set of bits certainly hasn't left me wanting. I also love that the screwdriver allows for mostly any bits to fit.
"I used the LTT screwdriver on a recent build and I love it. Usually I use my little iFixit screwdriver because my kit has every bit under the sun, but the iFixit driver is tiny and even though I have small hands, sometimes I need something with more of a grip. The original bit set that comes with the screwdriver is a good mix, but I picked these up so I have anything I might need for fixing stuff. The bits seem like very good quality and I'm satisfied with them."
"I got em all, just in case. And already used to fix some stuff, like a pan with a wobbly handle, now firm once again."

"Lol sorry for the pun... These bits are great, thanks for making them."
"This was a Christmas gift requested by my son. I ordered it a little late so as expected, it arrived after Christmas but he knew they were coming. When it arrived he discovered there was a duplicate set (missing one set) and called customer service. They were wonderful and made sure the missing set was shipped immediately. Great customer service."
Would be 4 1/2 stars if it would let me.  Only complaint is lack of storage case.  I did find that Wera's 60 bit folding case is a perfect match for those looking for something  to hold them.  Would definitely recommend and won't hesitate to order again when i lose them.

I used it to build medical kiosks recently and its convenient all the bits  I need are in one place.
"If I find myself needing e bits, I will buy more. If the quality wasn‚Äôt good I wouldn‚Äôt give you my money again. Since I would give you more money that should be enough to say ‚Äúwell done‚Äù."
"My T10 Torx bit deformed slightly after like 5 screws, i excepted the steel to be stronger on these. It's still useable for now tho so i'll just be more carefull with them in the future.\nOther than that the sets are nice and complete and the magnets in them work great + i like how the bit model is engraved in the bit."
"The bits are nice, but they are in tiny cardboard boxes.  \nPlease please please design and sell bit holders or a storage box or organizer or something."
"my only issue with these sets is the fact that there is no official storage case available. Aside, they're bits. They get used, sometimes overused, and are expected to be replaced with heavy use. Really do hope they do a large bit set release at some point, with case of course, but for now, content with my three additional sets. Guess its wait and see for now."

"Before get into review, I‚Äôd recommend this screwdriver all day ,one, even w/ the minor 2 issues it has. \nHated to delete 2 stars for the following, but have to be fair and as dint have ¬Ω stars‚Ä¶.no choice. For comparison, Milwaukee (a fav brand and Klein; had 1 and 0 stars respectively for the ratcheting screwdrivers b/c of slop, storage breakage of Klein, and hardbjt removal on Milwaukee to name just a few that I reviewed after 4 mins this of use)\n1) would prefer the silver color for bits just like the silver shaft, as the black is wearing right off and quickly \n2) the size/number of bit is pretty much impossible to read w/ the black coating, not to mention, black coating wearing off and makes it harder. If Bit No/size a black 9r same color of the silver shaft, would be so much easier to read; & for those not in construction trades and don‚Äôt know bit size by site,  Ames it quite difficult to read. So much so, I‚Äôve got 4 ppl on my crew pulling out cell camera to zoom in to see what bit size they have; especially for the ones not used daily‚Ä¶.like specially, torx, hex, Phillips bit sets that can go down to ‚Äú0-00‚Äù zies etc‚Ä¶\nLastly, having the black coating flake off into sensitive electronics can be bad; but I‚Äôve yet to have had an issue personally from this, and hope never will.\nAs I like the black, especially when receiving my multiple black shaft ‚Äòdrivers, gonna look pretty awesome! Making my total number of screwdrivers to 5 And total bit packs to  19 total, yep, that‚Äôs right; cuz when in electronics repair and definitely the trades (a sparky, GC, remodeled, & doing a lot of hardware installs‚Ä¶can wear thru bits quite fast, depending on use case). If the color and stamped ‚Äúbit size/number‚Äù  being an issue‚Ä¶.5/5 all day long, and do like the fit, magnet, & storage in handle more than any of my other 40 screwdrivers. Lastly, the ratchet selector mechanism is actually CORRECT and not backwards from all others, so thx Linus for pushing this feature! Otherwise, balance great, bits so easy to remove/replace in storage handle and use! My fav screwdriver to date and definitely my fav ratcheting screwdriver period!  Nothing comes close for price, features, functions, AND USING. \nNow I‚Äôm just waiting for that Srubby, and be happy to test for you, cuz having a stubby for hvac/plumbing/electrical, cabinet installs‚Ä¶.are very valuable, imo."
"I like the screwdriver a lot, it's exactly as advertised and works great."
"Just got my ltt screwdriver as a late Christmas present, used it to pull apart my gaming laptop and clean it. Worked great can't wait for the next little project"
"I bought all the sets, as a field tech that have yet to fail me. I also carryall full Ifixit Pro and with out both the drivers and the kit I wouldn't be able to do my job as well as I do."
I bought the bits for my husband to go along with the awesome screwdriver he has. He is very happy with the bits and screwdriver :)

"Great customer service, they reshipped my order of severak items including these, as for their performance, they're hex bits, not much can happen to them unless you try to break them, the ratchet would give out first regardless, so as far as they intended purpose goes, they're indestructible, which is great!"
"No modification needed. Good price for the bits. Love the content and this was a great way to support this team of individuals. Can you buy random bits not the right length of course. It was nice to have a wide selection, I would have liked to have seen them all packaged together though that was the only down side. Maybe a small case for all the bits but it is a moot point. Buy them if you want them."
"The screw driver lives in my backpack, and I will get most of the extra  attachements. but..... could we get a box(or maybe 2/3 different sizes?) where we could fit them? The cardboard boxes will not survive very long in a daily use backpack ;)"
Terrible quality control and super delayed customer service
Fit perfectly the screwdriver (obviously) and is great with the strong magnet. Really satisfied!

I purchased the LTT screwdriver; which is amazingly useful; and one of the straight bits was pointed rather than straight. LTT replaced the entire standard set of bits and offered me a second set as well.\nI love all the bits and I use the screwdriver around the house all the time. It is my go-to screwdriver. I have all the bit sets now so I am hoping Linus is working on a bit holder.\nGreat customer support and great product.
There really should be a box to hold these üòä\nIf one is made available on the store i will update this review to 5 stars (had my brother print a temporary box but he didn't have flexible printing material üòÇ)
"When you guys announced the driver I was so jazzed to get my hands on it.  Watching how much effort went into the design,the materials and testing.  If this thing was on the same level as the 3! Dad hats I've purchased over the last 3 years,  I knew I was in for a great experience.  This driver does not disappoint, love the handle design, big fan of the bit storage, and the ratcheting action and magnet make every job easier! I was an employee of Home Depot for 15 years and in all that time, every driver I've had in hand can't hold a candle to the LTT driver. You all have achieved insane quality without gouging your customers ala Snap-on or other big brands. Only question I have is there would be plans to do a \""game bit\"" for working on Super Nintendo and such?"
"This has been on my hip for 40 hours a week at my job ever since I got this screwdriver, and its yet to let me down. The one thing I don't have is a great place to store all the specialty bits I also ordered. I'm not going to be able to keep them in the LTT cardboard forever every time I have to swap out my bit loadouts. I might have to 3D print a holder for all my lesser used security bits."
"Bought 2 sets of the Metric Hex Set and 2 sets off the Torx / Security Torx Set.  The Torx set is good from what I have used of it so far, so I would recommend them.  "

"I got the bits with the screwdriver. They're really nice.\nHowever I'm missing pz1 and pz2 bits a lot, since I'm more of a hobbyist than pc builder, and in Europe the PZ bits are more widely used than PH.\nTried to search for them online, impossible to find, so I'll have to buy some regular ones and cut the 5mm off. Tedious :("
"Hey Linus, you've said on the WAN show several times that you read every review so I figured this may be the best place to make this request. Would you please look into adding JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) bits to the options for the screwdriver? On all Japanese motorcycles (and presumably cars as well?) the cross head screws and bolts that appear to be phillips are NOT that, but rather they are JIS. They look very similar, but trying to use a standard phillips driver on a JIS fastener very often results in the fastener stripping out and having to then be drilled out. As a mechanic, having the proper tool makes a big difference and I would love to make your already kickass screwdriver an even more versatile tool in my toolbox. I know I may be in the minority as it's mostly tech enthusiasts who are buying this tool, but I've been shilling it to all my fellow mechanics as it is already a well built driver that stands up to real world abuse in a mechanic shop. Thanks for hearing me out and congrats on your much deserved success!"
Bits are too short to be compatible with the nVidia Shield Portable Game System?
"Very versatile collection, it would be interesting to think of a more solid packaging than the cardboard box!"
"Fantastic, got a bunch of different sets, glad I got them."

Great selection of bits. Has different bits not included anywhere else.
"I usually do my research after the fact, but in this case I made an exception and bought both the screwdriver and the backpack. Was not disappointed in either! Both, but especially the backpack, far exceed my expectations for \""merch\"". I expected that given how long I've watched LTT, but it is gratifying to know for sure (and show a bit of support for the years of free videos)."
"The bits are fine on their own. My biggest complaint about the LTT Screwdriver is its lack of storage. I want there to be a way to properly store all the bits when not in the handle of the screwdriver. Think something like the bit storage with iFixit kits. There could be one with a slot to set down the driver along with all the bits, or another option would be a small box that just manages all the bits. "
"Still waiting on my screwdriver (ordered bits first), quality seems nice but don‚Äôt fit in any of my existing drivers to test properly. Desperately needs a dedicated bit holder. The cardboard box they came in is already torn just from shipping and the bits are just flopping around inside. "
I like the bits but I have noticed they have a tendency of not seating fully causing some wear where the bit and the ltt screwdriver meet I'm not sure how this will play in the long run but I can say it's not getting any better

"The quality is the exact same quality as the bits that come with the screwdriver. So far they seem to be strong and mostly durable. They seem just as good as any other bit, they just fit in the screwdriver cleaner than regular bits. As mentioned in the note in the product description, the bits do wear after some general use. The tips of the black bits do wear down to a silver. This hasn't affected functionality though, so this isn't an issue for me."
I got the bits nearly 13 weeks later and even after emailing 6 times and 5 days before the shipped to cancel. They still sent them. Disregarding my request and the fact that they arrived late even later then they recommended waiting
I haven't gotten the screwdriver yet so I cant tell
That's a lot of variety 0.o
Good solid bits.

Probably the best bit sets you can buy for computer building. Most bit sets do not include small enough drives for some PC tasks. They are compatible with non-LTT drivers. I use them with a PB Swiss ratcheting driver. Would like to see a complete set with a hard case in the future.
I love all the fine little details of the screwdriver the noise it makes when it ratchets. Down to the bit storage this screwdriver was worth the price.  My only suggestion would be sell a bit storage item as an option to store all the other extra bits we may buy later on.
Screwdriver Bit Set
"I got all the extra bit sets and I now have a mix of the most perfect bits for my job. I'm so happyI got this whole set and I have no regrets. I will always pick this screwdriver over any others I could use. (\""It's perfectly balanced, Like all things should be\"")"
No thorough review here. Just straight to the point. \nOutstanding!

"Yes, it's pricey but it's worth every penny. I've been using it every chance I get, and it feels great to use. The on-board bit holder keeps all the bits I need ready when I need them, and the ratchet is very satisfying. The magnet is very strong and doesn't drop screws when I'm working. This screwdriver will always be in my bag."
"Been following this product for a while and bought it right away. It arrived a few days ago and I've been using it a lot. The build is satisfyingly clean, it has a reassuring wieght to it and the rachet is amazing. Its something I'll definitely chuck in my bag so I'll always have it on me"
Bits are fabricated with tight tolerances and very clean. Bits have a nice weight to them and will hopefullt serve there purpose for may years.

"I haven't had a chance to use any yet but the finish is perfect, hollow ground on the flats and no burs to be found. \nThe packs themselves are very hard to open without tearing the card stock construction, there is nothing retaining the bits inside and WHEN the holder finally tears you'll just have to store them loose or buy and modify a cheap 3rd party holder to fit the smaller bit shanks. "

The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the cardboard but holder and yes I know that LTT knows this and want to fix it I just had to say it
"Got a wave one screwdriver and have been absolutely loving it since it arrived. I decided to expand and grab the metric and specialty bit sets. High quality product, great price, and they arrived faster than the delivery estimate. I wish I would have read the reviews closer because I was disappointed to realize that they don't include a sturdy bit holder. I assume a solution is coming from the store in the near future, but I would have been willing to pay a few extra dollars in this purchase for something more sturdy than the cardboard boxes they are shipped in."
"Big fan of the channel and I just received my screwdriver. I work in the HVAC trade, so I have a fair collection of tools. This screwdriver has been a great addition, but I was curious if you could recommend some small driver bits that might fit inside the base? The default socket on the screwdriver appears to be 1/4‚Äù but I see a lot of 5/16‚Äù in my trade. I‚Äôve been looking online without much success."
It really good but it was kinda annoying/ made me sad when it took 6months to get to me I thought I didn‚Äôt order it after a while but it magically showed up today
I bought the extra bits incase I broke one and I didn't realize that the torx bits I needed were security (ps4 cleaning)

"Now, I get that we all strive to be \""eco\"" this and \""bio\"" that, but this item is packaged straight-up wrong.\nOnly 7/12 bits arrived safe, the rest are lost - the bigger box that my shipment arrived in was \""sealed\"", but not \""hermetically sealed\"". Actually, that's another thing... why isn't either of the boxes even properly sealed with scotch tape? How does such a rookie mistake even happen?"

i ordered all 5 sets but have no case for them? perhaps design and manufacture a case for storing an entire set?
"Bit sets look good, but with the driver still in Vancouver for the past few days, cannot give a review yet."
"Honestly I have nothing bad to say, but the only reason I bought a set of bits is because I didn‚Äôt know if the LTT driver (no ragrats) had them or not. So now when I jay‚Äôs 2 cents cosplaying linus my driver, at least I know I have a second set where one won‚Äôt socket. \nTop tier."
"Every LTT video interrupted by \""get screwdriver', sometimes 2 or 3 times.  So I did.  I actually got 2.  figured a good Christmas present for my friend.   The order was confirmed with 2-6 day delivery   That was on August 21st last year.  I e-mailed and was told there was a wait that I agreed to do when I signed up.  And still, I watch the ads for this great screwdriver on the videos.  On Dec. 24th I got an e-mail saying 'shipment data received' and here we are.  The bits seem great.  Unfortunately I've been waiting for something to put them in since Summer.  Keep this in mind next time you see the smarmy reviews about how long wish takes, or how crowd sourced projects end up taking months (years?) longer than they were promised.  Apparently delays happen to the best of 'em."

Overall great quality and finish. However I was a bit confused because they are shiny and the bits that came with the screwdriver are matte.
The paper/cardboard box it comes in isn‚Äôt heed to keep them sorted

I think personally I would have preferred silver rather than the black finish but I guess it's down to my poor eyesight. Anyway I find it hard to see which bit I'm selecting from the pack or from the storage in the screwdriver.
"They do what they are supposed to. I haven't lost or broken any, but these packs are very affordable and I was able to buy plenty of extras."
"I use the hex bits on a daily basis opening up cnc machines, they‚Äôve held up great. The phosphate coating wears off, as almost all coatings wear off. They have not rounded off or deformed. They fit into fasteners very well."

All the bits work great. Printed a bit holder from thingiverse to hold them all.
The bits are great but I need a box to keep them organized. I bought all the bit sets and I need a box to hold just the bits so can keep all the ones I rarely need in my bag for the occasions where I really need them. It doesn't have to hold the screwdriver just the bits with markings to keep them organized.
"Every iPhone since the 5 (almost a decade) has used the same standoffs to hold the logic board down.  I purchased four of the screwdrivers with specialty bit addons for the whole team in our repair shop.  My hope was to replace all of the cheap bits/screwdrivers we have in house, especially the y000/0.6 that never seem to fit right.  I thought these would have all the specialty bits I would need for a small repair shop, but as I replaced all the commonly used iFixit bits in my silicone mat with these I realized that the iPhone standoff bit I use almost daily was not a part of the specialty bit set (or any offered here).  "
"These bits seem very brittle, I had the T6H break on its first use and had to use a bit from another brand's set to complete the job :("
"The bits seem well made, and the material seems good. My only complaint is just that there isn't a great storage option for additional bits. Since they're shorter than usual 1/4\"" bits they don't fit super well into either of the 1/4\"" bit holders I've got. Each set comes in small paper boxes, which is good for sustainability, but not great for long term storage of the extra bits. They could use a little bit holder sized appropriately to these."

"The screwdriver is very well made, the tolerances are perfect, the ratchet action is really nice and tight. If Linus reads this review, I would like to suggest that the extra bit sets be sold in a combo pack with a case with an all-black or black and orange option with a black or stainless metal clasp, also put a hole on it that's big enough to put a carabiner through it."
I used all of the extra bit heads that I ordered to build PCs/ 3D printer/cat house/moar stuff. The largest hex bit head was often not big enough besides that one downfall. The bits are durable and I liked them.
The bits look fine. \nThe packaging could use some improvement.\nThe stamping on the bits should get a lot of improvement.\nOverall I love them and I will be restocking some of the other variants too.
"It's screwdriver bits, for the LTT screwdriver. Pretty simple! The specific ones I needed for my old gameboy worked perfectly."
Good quality. Glad I finally got them

Bits no driver.
"Have all the bits, but waiting for the driver. I'm sure it'll be good with all the care ltt put into it"
"I bought 9 sets of bits, about 3 of them arrived in tact, 2 were partially in tact, and 4 had come open during shipping and were scattered throughout the package. "
"All bits arrived, but they arrived scattered around the main packaging. I appreciate LTT trying to reduce plastic use and keeping packaging somewhat minimal, but they need to figure out something to keep the bits in the package so the bits don't end up scattered around the main package."
"These are good bits (as good as the ones that come with the Screwdriver), the only grief is that it comes in a thin cardboard holder and there is no way it'll hold anything in after a few open/close. Even being cautious opening it for the first time didn't prevent some tear in the cardboard."

Screwdriver Bit Set
Not what I thought I was getting
So far no issues with the screwdriver or bits. I have lost 2 of the bits. I purchased all the bit sets. 36 bits and only storage for 12 in the screwdriver. Need to offer a case for bit storage....looking @ the reviews apparently I'm not the only one with this issue.

Was better than I could‚Äôve imagined
Where are the PZ bits? They're so common where I live in Europe that I would love to see pz bits added.\nIkea screws are almost all PZ and so are a lot of electrical outlet screws now a days.
"The bits I ordered scratch easily, so the black coating won‚Äôt look as nice after using them a few times. And the largest metric hex bit kept getting stuck when I used my screwdriver to take my desk apart. But overall they are handy bits which do their job just fine."
"The driver itself is very good. Hand-grip is great, ratcheting works well. My only gripe is with all the bits you have with this‚Ä¶it NEEDS A CASE to hold everything. I can‚Äôt take it with me on the road. Something will get lost."

"My only real feedback is that I'd like to have a nice place to store and organize all my bits, since I bought every one of the sets!"
"I kind of love these bits. The quality seems excellent, and the variety is equally good. The overall selection is almost a superset of my old iFixit kit."
"I bought each set to go with my LTT screwdriver. I'm happy with them but I have a couple of notes to make it perfect : black is pretty but hard to see the engraved size on it and I know it might be an European thing but why not a Pozidriv set, they are like everywhere here (I have a big ifixit set of bits, they got almost every bits you offer and little more like a complete set of Pozidriv)."
"The bits are fine. Not a huge fan of black as it makes it just a little extra difficult in poor lightning to tell which bit is which, but i'll give it a pass because it looks cool. That being said especially with the smaller sizes it becomes hard to tell. \nalready when putting a bit back into the packaging I can't tell if I've put it in the correct order or not.  "

"First, I echo the need for a basic bit holder. This is especially needed for us heavy hex users. I ended up buying a set of Wiha bits just for their excellent holder."
"I purchased every set of bits available.  So far, every one of them performs as expected.  They are great!  But I'm dumbfounded by the your decision to not include a holder for each set.  Even the absolute cheapest sets of bits that can be found on Amazon - you know, the ones from China - even those have holders, and they include more bits - like 7-8x more - for the same price or less than LTT's sets.  Surely the cost associated with including a holder is negligible at best."
They are sturdy and worth the price!
The bit sets themselves get 5 stars for quality. The form factor and material choice us perfect. 
"I love having all the bit sets ready to go at a moments notice! I highly recommend grabbing them all, because you never know when they'll come in handy!"

Screwdriver Bit Set
Yea still waiting on the screwdriver to actually use them but they look great.
"Recently built my little brothers computer. While not using the extra set of bits I bought. The quality across the board is great! I also used a PH3 bit to tighten a bolt with the top being Philips and a socket wrench held at the bottom, connecting a tripod mount to cinder blocks. I tightened using the LTT screwdriver with all my might. It handled it like a champ"
I ordered every pack to make sure my husband cod get the most use out of the LTT screwdriver. So far very pleased.
I still don't have a screwdriver.  Bits could be awesome. Packaging is nice and minimalistic which is good for eco minded people. On

"Bits: no issues\nPackaging: my metric hex set box arrived opened and the bits are everywhere in the delivery box, luckily everything was there. My other set was fine. It seems like this is a common issue, maybe tape to make sure the box doesn‚Äôt open (but excessive use of plastic or a recyclable tape idk does it exist) or maybe a redesign (man hours but for good user experience right)"
"This is better than I originally thought.  Its much bigger screwdriver than I thought it would be and after using I realize why.  Bigger is so it doesn't fall out of your hand while using.  I compared it to other smaller screwdrivers I have at home and in the past the screwdrivers would fall out of my hand.  But not this one.  Also I think you should not include flat head bits in your screwdriver.  Nothing uses flat head, everything is philips or hex, TRs.  I bought the TR bits and going to replace others with it."
"Received my screwdriver and specialty bits today. And while I'm excited and happy with the screwdriver and main bits, the specialty bits came with a few flaws. I received two P6 bits and no P5, as well as an unmarked bit. The unmarked bit seems like it should be the Y000 bit but it is the same size as the Y00 bit."
"I bought one of each bit set and have had no issues with any of the bits. I do wish there was a bit storage holder aside from the screwdriver itself, but that has nothing to do with the quality of these bits. If I ever loose any bits I will definitely have no doubts about buying these again."
"The bits seems to be high quality and I love the extra magnet strenght they provide over standard bits. But you guys rly need to fix the packaging, when I recived my box of stuff including the screwdriver, my 3 extra packs of bits had all opened during shipping, and the bits were all mixed in the bottom of the box. Two of the packs were also ripped open so now I dont have any way of storing them in an organized manner. "

Bit quality is great.
Screwdriver Bit Set
"The non-standard length, well, that's just silly and lacks imagination, kind of like selling bits in only a cardboard box rather than with a clip to hold them."
"I don't know how many times I find I need a TORX bit for something and can't seem to ever find the right one. There are 12 of them in the TORX set ranging from T3 to T30! I shouldn't have any trouble getting the right one now and is a must in my toolbox. Combined with all the bits that come with the screwdriver I have a lot of great options should I need them. The only downside I see is that the bits come in a cardboard box so it's kind of useless to store them in it. I would have loved to have the option to buy a durable bit storage box to keep them in, and I may have even picked up some additional bit packages just in case. Overall great product and has a nice range of available bits, but the storage options could have been better."
"I purchased 1 of EACH bit set. Save yourself some time and just buy 1 of each NOW. FYI, when you buy these, go ahead and magnetic or rubberized bit holders on Amazon. The screwdriver comes with the \""Standard\"" bit set but I would recommend buying a backup set as well."

"The bits seem to be good enough quality. But I'm frustrated that there's no re-usable holder for them. I bought every bit set so that my LTT Screwdriver would be ready for whatever I throw at it. But these flimsy paper packages are not going to hold up in my tool bag. And there's nothing holding the bits in place. So if you take one out for use, the remaining bits will move around in the package, so you can't quickly place the bit back where it was maintaining order."
I bought the speciality and security torxs bit sets. I have used them for a week now and they seem really high quality (no fraying). One problem i have is that the bits were just tossed loosely in the box and the specilaity bit set opened up and they were shattered around the box. 3 bits were missing. I would like to see an improvement in the packaging
"Let's do it, LTT team - custom bit holder please."
Not what I was expecting. It doesn‚Äôt fit any of my drivers I own.
"For being so small abs fitting into the screwdriver the way they do it‚Äôs great, they don‚Äôt chip or bend when being used abs it is perfect for making and repairing computers"

The bits are great. However a bit holder for the additional bits would be great rather than storing them in the cardboard boxes that they ship in.
"So I use a lot of the H2 (2mm) and H2.5 (2.5mm) for RC race cars and the bits are way too loose for me. I use MIP tools for RC and they are amazing, but uncomfortable, so when I bought the LTT screwdriver I was excited that it came with 2 and 2.5mm hex bits because I didn't doubt my boi Linus about the comfort. Unfortunately the Hexes are loose and the 2mm actually measured 1.95mm on my calipers and that is bad when it comes to small screws that need to be tight for competitive RC racing. the 2.5mm bit was 2.47 and 3mm was spot on and felt great.  MIP tools use a flat sharp tip and these are more soft and rounded. Wouldn't recommend these if you need to remove some screws that have Loctite on them. screwdriver is amazing though. My boi Linus didn't lie when he said \""trust me bro\"""
Love the screwdriver and the bits themselves are good. I bought 3 additional bit sets with my screwdriver and 2/3 of them were opened and the bits scattered through the shipping box rattling around loose. For how much Linus focuses on packaging of products he reviews I expected a lot more there tbh.
"I ended up buying all of the available bit packages, except for the standard bit set since th at already came with the screwdriver."
More bits than a megabyte

Amazing delivery and quality
"I love my Torx bits so far. I have only used them a bit, but they have been great."
"Great bit set, wish there was a way to store them when not in the screwdriver. "
"So the loss of a star is because of the packaging. 2 of my bit boxes were opened and torn in the package and bits were loose. A small sticker on the opening tab should have prevented this and should be easy and low cost to add.\nBesides shipping my first impressions are that these bits look and feel like good quality. \nThey're a consumable so your mileage will vary. Also 100% need a bit storage solution, I'll probably design and print my own, but not everyone has access to these sorts of tools, so purchasing one would be a nice option.\nExcited to put these bad boys to use"
Great

Amazing produc
"Great so far, rare to see Torx sets go so small so that's nice.\nSome of the stamps are deep and clear others really light. My t25 bit was not stamped at all though, that's why the star loss.\nMore variety would be nice to see in the future too, pozi, socket adapter or nut drivers in the low profile style etc."
"The bits are nice. It's hard to put into words but they feel like quality. As a side, I was a bit disappointed to see that they are not compatible with my ifixit drivers. So fair warning to people that did not pay attention to the size of these bits like me."
If you're a nerd you'll need these. Make sure to have a place to store them.
"Great to have, work well, make sure you have storage for the bits as the cardboard box won't last"

"Bits work great, just need to get some shortage for them"
"Great quality, exactly what I was expecting"
"The screwdriver is great, but not having a PZ2 and PZ3 bits in a set is a big flaw for me. :/"
"I wish we could order custom sets. I dont need 3 times the same bit, nor do I need all the bits from the speciality set for exemple."

I'm interested in seeing the bits in action myself.  But i was a mechanic for 5 years and i now work as a datacenter tech and we use philips2 and t30/t27 regularly for Skylake CPU's and i find not having any selection that offers a Philips and a T30 a little disappointing for custom made driver for pc and general purpose use.
Bought one of each additional bitset at the popup shop the packaging is very nice. quality of the bits are great. We need a carrying case for the extra bits please!

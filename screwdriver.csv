"Great addition to the ltt screwdriver, wonderful quality"
"Great addition to the ltt screwdriver, wonderful quality"
"As advertised. Good quality, aesthetically matches the LLT screwdriver. Shipping takes a bit longer,
                    but to be expected when involving customs."
"Standard set, mostly the same as what came with the screwdriver."
"I have noticed that some of my bits are starting to wear out from the tip, but that is totally normal
                    wear and tear after use. I am quite happy for the paint job, cause it is still holding extremely
                    well. Even better than iron in the tip :DDD"
